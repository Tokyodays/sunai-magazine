## 020 Warning: How to Identify Genuine Magnetic Chucks and Avoid Counterfeits [China Market Edition]

### 1. The Counterfeit Problem in the Chinese Magnetic Chuck Market

Precision machining demands reliable workholding. A magnetic chuck that releases a workpiece unexpectedly — or fails to hold it flat — can ruin a part, damage a machine, or injure an operator. Yet across the Chinese market, counterfeit magnetic chucks have proliferated at price points that seem attractive, until failures occur.

Common failure modes reported from counterfeit units include holding force below 50% of the stated specification, sudden magnetic force loss mid-operation, poor surface flatness leading to inaccurate machining, and residual magnetism that cannot be properly cleared after use. These are not abstract risks. Genuine Sun Ai magnetic chucks such as the SM-H series have been independently tested at Iwate University, demonstrating ON holding force approximately twice that of conventional products and OFF residual force reduced to approximately 1/5. Counterfeits cannot replicate these results because they do not use the same magnet configurations, surface finish tolerances, or ON/OFF switching mechanisms.

The SM-H series, for example, achieves ON magnetic flux density clearly stronger and OFF magnetic flux density clearly weaker than standard products — a distinction visible in surface magnetic flux density measurements. Counterfeits typically show weak ON performance and poor OFF switching, leaving residual magnetism that contaminates workpieces with iron particles after machining.

### 2. Why Counterfeits Are Dangerous — Not Just Disappointing

Beyond the performance gap, counterfeit magnetic chucks present real safety hazards. Sun Ai's catalog-documented safety notice states that when clamping space is reduced through the use of spacers or underscore sets, the risk of workpiece falling increases, and extreme care must be taken. This warning applies to genuine products used with optional accessories. For counterfeits, the baseline holding force is already unreliable, making workpiece fall risk a constant concern even under normal clamping conditions.

The SM-CNO series (genuine Sun Ai) is noted in official documentation to have no ON/OFF function — and operators must remove watches and precision instruments during use because of the strong magnetic field (central MAX 4,000 Gauss on SM-CNO1112). Counterfeit products bearing similar model numbers may omit this warning entirely, putting operators at risk.

A genuine Sun Ai magnetic chuck carries patent No. 5716232 and design registration No. 1666196, covering innovations such as the unique L-design air-controlled clamping mechanism and the demagnetizing function that eliminates the need for post-machining demagnetization. Counterfeits can copy the appearance but cannot replicate the engineering behind these protections.

### 3. Five Checkpoints to Identify Genuine Sun Ai Magnetic Chucks

**Checkpoint 1 — Product Marking and Serial Number**

Genuine Sun Ai products are clearly marked with the "Sun Ai" brand and carry traceable model designations such as SM-1530, SM-H1015, SM-C1580, or SWL-H190AB. Model numbers follow a consistent, documented system. If a product's model number cannot be cross-referenced against official Sun Ai catalog specifications, treat it with suspicion. Contact Sun Ai directly (sunai@pup.waiwai-net.ne.jp / TEL +81-197-35-5518) to verify.

**Checkpoint 2 — Magnetic Force Measurement Data Sheet**

Genuine products are backed by documented performance data. For example, the SWL-H190AB+ has a measured ON holding force of 0.16T and OFF residual of 0.008T. The SWL-H190AB and SWL-H100αβ measure 0.06T ON and 0.006T OFF. Request measurement data when purchasing. A seller unable to provide model-specific holding force figures (in kgf or Tesla) for the exact unit is a red flag.

For reference, the genuine SM standard series holding forces measured at the center using a 50×50mm test piece range from 80 kgf (SM-0710) to 130 kgf (SM-2040 through SM-5075). Residual magnetism across the series is approximately ≤5 kgf. These are catalog-documented values — demand equivalent documentation from any seller.

**Checkpoint 3 — Surface Finish Quality**

Sun Ai magnetic chucks are precision-ground. The SM-C series for cemented carbide features a surface pitch of 8mm (2:6 or 4:4 depending on model), and the SM-H Hyper series achieves surface flatness enabling parallelism at the 0.001mm level. Run your finger across the surface: genuine products feel uniformly smooth and flat. Counterfeit units often show uneven polishing, visible scratches, or irregular pole pitch spacing.

For the SM series sign bar magnetic chuck (SM series integrated sign bar), the roller center distance accuracy is rated first class, with center-to-center positioning of ±0.0035mm or less over 50mm. This level of surface precision cannot be faked with low-cost manufacturing. Visually inspect the pole faces for uniformity.

**Checkpoint 4 — Packaging and Documentation**

Genuine Sun Ai products ship with documentation including specifications, safety notes, and accessory information. The SM-CNO series documentation explicitly warns that the product has no OFF function and instructs operators to remove precision instruments including watches. The SWL-H190 series documentation details the workpiece fall risk when clamping space is reduced. Counterfeit products often arrive without any such safety documentation, or with generic, poorly translated materials that do not match the specific model.

**Checkpoint 5 — Authorized Distributor Verification**

Purchase only through verified channels. Sun Ai inc. is headquartered at 127-1 Kanaya Odaki Esashi, Iwate, Japan. Official contact: TEL +81-197-35-5518, FAX +81-197-35-5527, E-mail: sunai@pup.waiwai-net.ne.jp, website: sunai.sk. Before purchasing through a Chinese distributor, confirm with Sun Ai directly that the distributor is authorized. Unauthorized resellers cannot provide warranty support or guarantee authenticity.

### 4. The Quality Assurance Behind Genuine Sun Ai Products

Sun Ai's quality assurance is not limited to claims — it is backed by independent testing and intellectual property registration. Key quality proofs include:

Patent No. 5716232 covers the air-controlled magnetic chuck mechanism with integrated demagnetizing function. Design registration No. 1666196 covers the unique L-design clamping form. The SM-H series was developed with support from national manufacturing subsidies (国のものづくり補助金) and tested by tribology expert Associate Professor Yoshino of Iwate University's Engineering Department. Milling tests on S50C material (70×80×10mm, cutter φ40mm, S1000, F200) demonstrated that the SM-3H achieves grinding-machine-level precision on a machining center. The electrode rotation device SER-01A achieves rotational runout of 0.002mm or less, confirmed in comparative testing against wire EDM alone — circularity improved from 0.0044 to 0.0015, and surface roughness improved from Ra1.1646 to Ra0.1279.

These are measured, documented results. If a seller cannot provide equivalent data for the product being sold, it is not a genuine Sun Ai product.

Furthermore, the STM series electrode holders carry a world-first distinction: all products use fine-pitch ball plunger adjustment screws (as of 2015), making adjustment 20% easier than conventional products and eliminating play or backlash during adjustment. This design detail is verifiable — examine the adjustment screws on any unit claiming to be an STM series holder.

## Summary

Three critical points to take away from this article:

First, counterfeit magnetic chucks in the Chinese market present real performance and safety risks — not just financial loss. Holding forces below specification and absent demagnetizing functions can cause workpiece falls and iron particle contamination.

Second, genuine Sun Ai products are verifiable through five checkpoints: product marking, magnetic force data sheets, surface finish quality, packaging and documentation, and authorized distributor verification.

Third, Sun Ai's quality assurance is backed by independent university testing, national manufacturing subsidies recognition, patent No. 5716232, and design registration No. 1666196 — not by marketing claims alone.
