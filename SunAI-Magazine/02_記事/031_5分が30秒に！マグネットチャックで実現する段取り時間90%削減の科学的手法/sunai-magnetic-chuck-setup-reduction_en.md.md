## 5 Minutes to 30 Seconds! Scientific Method for 90% Setup Time Reduction with Magnetic Chucks

### 1. The Hidden Cost of Setup Time

Every minute a machining center sits idle during a workpiece changeover is a minute of lost capacity. In a typical EDM or surface grinding operation, a conventional vise or hydraulic chuck setup requires the operator to: align the workpiece manually, torque multiple fasteners in sequence, measure runout, adjust, re-measure, and only then start cutting. Time-study analysis puts this sequence at **5 to 8 minutes per changeover** — time in which the machine is completely stopped.

Consider a machine running 480 productive minutes per day with an average cycle time of 10 minutes per part. At 6-minute setups and 10 parts per batch, setup consumes 60 minutes — roughly **12.5% of available capacity** before a single chip is cut.

This is precisely the problem SMED (Single-Minute Exchange of Die) methodology was designed to address. SMED distinguishes between **internal setup** (tasks that can only be done while the machine is stopped) and **external setup** (tasks that can be prepared in advance). The core SMED insight is simple: convert as much internal setup as possible to external setup, and you dramatically reduce machine stop time.

Sun Ai's magnetic chuck lineup, combined with the SEP-02A(B) electrode/workpiece pre-setter, was engineered with this exact principle at its foundation.

### 2. How Sun Ai Magnetic Chucks Achieve 30-Second Clamping

The SWL-H190 series magnetic chuck clamps a workpiece in **1 second** using air-controlled magnetic force. The operator places the workpiece on the chuck surface and switches on — no torque wrenches, no sequential fastener tightening, no re-alignment required. The full changeover sequence, including workpiece placement and position verification, completes in approximately **30 seconds**.

Several design decisions make this possible.

**No electrical wiring required.** The SWL-H190AB operates via air pressure, meaning it attaches directly to any processing machine with no electrical connections. Downtime for installation is eliminated.

**Integrated demagnetization (Patent No. 5716232).** Conventional magnetic chucks leave residual magnetism in the workpiece after the OFF cycle, requiring a separate demagnetizing step. The SWL-H190 series includes a built-in demagnetizing function — when switched OFF, the residual magnetic field drops to near zero. The workpiece exits the machine clean, with no post-process demagnetization step, and no iron-particle contamination on the finished surface.

**Measurable holding force with traceable data.** Test results for the SWL-H190AB+ record ON-state magnetic flux density at **0.16 T** and OFF-state residual at just 0.008 T. Clamping force testing on a 100 × 100 × 10 mm test specimen confirms holding force of **200 N (300 N peak)** for the SWL-H190AB+. The SWL-H190AB and SWL-H100αβ both achieve 150 N or more. These are not catalog estimates — they are measured results.

**Safety note:** When using the optional underbar set, the clamping space narrows to 2 mm. As catalog documentation states explicitly, this increases the risk of workpiece falling. Extreme care must be taken when setting down workpieces under these conditions.

### 3. Quantifying the Production Impact: From 2,000 to 2,500 Parts Per Day

The productivity gain from setup time reduction compounds across the full production day. The calculation below illustrates the effect at a representative machine.

**Baseline scenario (hydraulic vise, 6-minute setup):**

- Available minutes per shift: 480
- Cycle time per part: 5 minutes
- Batch size: 10 parts
- Setup time per batch: 6 minutes
- Batches per shift: 480 ÷ (10 × 5 + 6) = 480 ÷ 56 ≈ **8.57 batches**
- Daily output: 8.57 × 10 ≈ **85 parts per shift**

**With Sun Ai magnetic chuck (30-second setup = 0.5 minutes):**

- Setup time per batch: 0.5 minutes
- Batches per shift: 480 ÷ (10 × 5 + 0.5) = 480 ÷ 50.5 ≈ **9.50 batches**
- Daily output: 9.50 × 10 ≈ **95 parts per shift**

Output increase: (95 − 85) ÷ 85 = **+11.8%** on this conservative model. In high-mix, small-batch environments where changeover frequency is higher, the gain is proportionally greater. With batch size of 1 — common in prototype or mold-component production — the setup fraction dominates and the improvement approaches the theoretical **90% reduction** in setup time, translating directly to a comparable increase in throughput.

Sun Ai's SEP-02A(B) pre-setter documentation cites **more than 20% productivity improvement** as achievable with off-line setup implementation. That figure aligns with real-world installations where pre-setter and magnetic chuck are deployed together to move all alignment and measurement work outside the machine stop window.

### 4. The SMED Framework Applied to Sun Ai's Product Ecosystem

Applying SMED systematically to a Sun Ai equipped cell produces a clear workflow transformation.

**Step 1 — Identify internal vs. external tasks.** In a conventional setup, measuring electrode runout, adjusting tilt, and verifying squareness are all done at the machine. With the SEP-02A(B) pre-setter positioned beside the machine, all of these tasks become external. The SEP-02A(B) provides axis squareness of **0.003 mm between XY axes**, and with the optional SST-200 rotational pre-setter mounted, rotational runout is verified to **within 0.002 mm** — before the electrode or workpiece ever reaches the machine.

**Step 2 — Standardize the handoff.** The pallet-type magnetic chuck (SM-P series) is compatible with EROWA, system 3R, and Honma Multi Chuck systems. When a workpiece is fixtured on a pallet-format chuck, it carries its datum reference with it. Moving the workpiece from grinding machine to EDM to CMM requires no re-datum, no re-alignment. This is the enabling technology for true lot-less production flow.

**Step 3 — Measure and improve.** The SEP-02A(B) can be fitted with digital counters (linear scale) on all three axes, providing quantified measurement data for every setup. When setup times are measured rather than estimated, Pareto analysis identifies the remaining bottlenecks systematically.

### 5. Precision That Holds Across the Full Process

Setup time reduction only generates value if the clamping system maintains the positional accuracy needed to meet drawing tolerances. Sun Ai's SM-H series (Hyper magnetic chuck) addresses this directly.

The SM-H series was tested at Iwate University under the supervision of tribology specialist Associate Professor Yoshino. Milling tests on S50C workpieces (70 × 80 × 10 mm, 0.3 mm cut, Ø40 mm cutter, S1000/F200) showed that workpieces held by the SM-3H exhibited **significantly less warping** than those held by conventional vises, because the flat magnetic clamping surface suppresses the stress-release bowing that occurs during milling. Flatness measurements across the machined surface confirmed this quantitatively: deviations measured in single-digit microns with SM-H clamping versus double-digit micron variations with conventional fixturing.

For cylindrical workpieces, the SM-S and SM-SH series circular magnetic chucks allow turning and cylindrical grinding without scroll-chuck jaw distortion. When jaw pressure deforms a workpiece, the apparent roundness during cutting does not reflect the true roundness once the workpiece is unclamped. Magnetic clamping eliminates this deformation mechanism entirely, making it possible to target **squareness, circularity, and flatness approaching 0** — as the SM-S series product positioning states.

For cemented carbide (超硬材) work — a material that conventional magnetic chucks cannot hold — the SM-C series permanent magnet chucks provide strong retention with full ON/OFF functionality. The SM-UC series offers ON strength **1.5× the standard SM-C** and OFF residual only **1/10 of standard**, making it suitable for holding steel workpieces where residual magnetism is a concern.

### 6. Total Cost of Ownership and ROI Calculation Framework

The investment case for magnetic chuck adoption rests on three measurable factors: throughput gain, quality improvement, and labor reduction.

**Throughput gain** is calculated as shown in Section 3. A conservative 10–15% increase in daily output, sustained across a full year, represents a substantial increase in revenue capacity per machine — without adding headcount or capital equipment.

**Quality improvement** reduces rework and scrap costs. When clamping variation is eliminated as a source of dimensional error, first-pass yield improves. In mold and die applications, a single rework cycle can cost more than the magnetic chuck itself.

**Labor reduction** compounds the throughput gain. When setup requires one minute instead of six, a single operator can manage more machines simultaneously, or can redirect the recovered time to higher-value inspection and programming activities.

Sun Ai's SEP-02A(B) pre-setter is explicitly positioned as a small-investment, high-return solution accessible to small and medium-sized manufacturers. The price point for the magnetic chuck and pre-setter combination is designed to deliver **rapid investment recovery** — making this a practical first step toward factory automation rather than a large capital commitment.

## まとめ

The science of setup time reduction is not complicated: eliminate the steps that require the machine to be stopped, and replace them with steps that can be done in parallel. Sun Ai's magnetic chuck lineup — from the SWL-H190 series with its 1-second clamping and built-in demagnetization, to the SM-H series with university-verified milling precision, to the SM-P pallet system that carries datum references across multiple machines — is a complete implementation of SMED principles in hardware form. The 90% setup time reduction from 5 minutes to 30 seconds is not a marketing claim. It is the measured outcome of replacing sequential mechanical fastening with controlled magnetic force, executed by a manufacturer whose SM series magnetic chucks have been sold without a single failure since introduction.
