## Body

### 1. Why Setup Time Is Your Hidden Cost Center

In most precision machining environments, the machine is the most expensive asset on the floor — yet it sits idle during workpiece setup. Every minute a machining center, surface grinder, or wire EDM is stopped for clamping and alignment is a minute of capacity lost forever.

The SEP-02A(B) electrode/workpiece pre-setter from 株式会社Sun Ai was designed around a single principle: place the pre-setter right next to the processing machine so that setup preparation happens in parallel with machining. This concept — known as **外段取り (off-line setup)** — is the foundation of the ROI model in this article.

Sun Ai's catalog documentation for the SEP-02A(B) states a productivity improvement potential of **20% or more** when off-line setup is implemented. For a facility running a single machining center at ¥5,000/hour on a 2-shift, 240-day annual schedule, a 20% capacity gain is equivalent to recovering approximately 384 machine-hours per year — or roughly ¥1,920,000 in additional productive capacity annually.

### 2. The Hidden Cost of Residual Magnetism

Conventional magnetic chucks leave residual magnetism in steel workpieces after machining. This forces operators to run a separate demagnetizing cycle before inspection or the next process — adding 5 to 15 minutes per workpiece and introducing the risk of iron particle contamination in subsequent EDM operations.

The SWL-H190AB series solves this with a patented built-in demagnetizing function (特許第5716232号). When switched off, the chuck executes an automatic demagnetizing cycle, reducing residual magnetism to the level shown in Sun Ai's published test data: the workpiece surface measured at or near **0 Gauss** in the central machining zone after release. This eliminates the standalone demagnetizing step entirely.

**Cost impact example:**

- Demagnetizing time per workpiece: 10 minutes
- Workpieces per shift: 12
- Labor cost: ¥2,500/hour
- Annual saving (240 days, 2 shifts): 10 min × 12 × 480 days × (¥2,500/60) = **¥600,000/year**

### 3. Spec-Based ROI Model: SM-H Series Milling-Compatible Magnetic Chuck

The SM-H hyper magnetic chuck series was developed with support from Japan's national manufacturing subsidy program (国のものづくり補助金) and tested at Iwate University by tribology specialist Associate Professor Yoshino. The published milling test results (S50C workpiece, 70×80×10mm, φ40mm cutter, S1000/F200) demonstrate that milling with SM-H fixturing reduces flatness deviation from the range of −10 to +12 microns (conventional vise) to +1 to +8 microns — a dramatic improvement that directly reduces rework and scrap.

The SM-H series also holds the **東北地方発明表彰** regional invention award and the **中小企業庁長官賞 (SME Agency Commissioner's Award)**, providing credible third-party validation of its technical merit.

**Defect cost reduction example:**

- Rework rate before SM-H: 3% of parts
- Monthly production: 500 parts
- Rework cost per part: ¥3,000
- Monthly rework cost: 500 × 3% × ¥3,000 = ¥45,000
- Estimated rework reduction with SM-H: 60% (based on flatness improvement data)
- Annual saving: ¥45,000 × 60% × 12 = **¥324,000/year**

### 4. Clamping Speed: 1 Second vs. Conventional Methods

The SWL-H190(100) air-controlled magnetic chuck clamps a 100×100×10mm workpiece in **1 second**. This is not a marketing claim — it is the result of Sun Ai's unique L-design (意匠登録第1666196号), which allows the chuck to be mounted directly on the wire EDM without electrical wiring. The catalog specification confirms: the unit is ready to machine immediately after attachment to the processing machine, with no wiring required.

Clamping force test results published by Sun Ai show the SWL-H190AB+ achieves **200N (300N peak)** holding force with a magnetic flux density of **0.16T ON / 0.008T OFF**, confirming that the OFF residual is negligible for post-process inspection.

**Setup time saving example (wire EDM application):**

- Old clamping method (mechanical): 8 minutes per workpiece
- SWL-H190 method: 1 second clamp + 3 minutes alignment = ~3 minutes total
- Time saving per workpiece: 5 minutes
- EDM machine rate: ¥4,000/hour
- Annual saving (200 workpieces × 240 days): 5 min × 200 × 240 × (¥4,000/60) = **¥16,000,000/year** _(for high-volume operations; scale to your actual volume)_

### 5. Full ROI Summary Table

The following table consolidates the savings categories above into a single investment analysis. Product pricing is indicative and should be confirmed with 株式会社Sun Ai directly, as prices were revised from July 2025 (令和7年7月).

|Cost Category|Annual Saving Estimate|
|---|---|
|Machine capacity recovered via 外段取り (20% gain on 1 machining center)|¥1,920,000|
|Demagnetizing process eliminated (SWL-H190AB patent)|¥600,000|
|Rework reduction via SM-H flatness improvement|¥324,000|
|Setup time reduction on wire EDM (moderate volume: 50 parts/day)|¥4,000,000|
|**Total estimated annual benefit**|**¥6,844,000**|

**Indicative investment range for a starter kit (SEP-02A(B) pre-setter + 2× SWL-H190AB + 1× SM-H1015):**

Based on published SM standard magnetic chuck pricing (SM-2040: ¥362,000; SM-3040: ¥510,000) as a cost reference, a complete entry-level magnetic chuck setup including pre-setter is typically positioned well below ¥3,000,000 — yielding a payback period under 6 months at the savings levels modeled above. Contact Sun Ai for a formal quotation.

> **Note on pricing:** The SM standard magnetic chuck series price list (SMマグネットチャック仕様表) was updated in July 2025 (令和7年7月). Always request the current price list before preparing an investment proposal.

### 6. Reducing Initial Outlay: Phased Adoption and Subsidies

For small and medium enterprises, the upfront cost of a full magnetic chuck system can be a barrier. Sun Ai's catalog explicitly acknowledges this, designing the SEP-02A(B) to be affordable for SMEs while delivering 20%+ productivity gains. Three approaches can reduce your net investment cost:

**Phased adoption:** Start with a single SWL-H190AB on the highest-utilization wire EDM. Measure actual setup time savings over 30 days, then use real data to justify the next purchase to your finance team.

**Government manufacturing subsidies:** The SM-H series was itself developed with Japan's 国のものづくり補助金 (Monozukuri Subsidy). Tooling investments that improve productivity and quality are frequently eligible for similar programs. Consult your local 商工会議所 (Chamber of Commerce) for current subsidy windows.

**Leasing:** Many precision tooling distributors offer operating lease structures for magnetic chuck systems, converting a capital expenditure into a monthly operating cost that may be immediately tax-deductible.

### 7. Spec Consistency Notes for Procurement Teams

When preparing a purchase specification or RFQ, use the following verified data points from Sun Ai's published catalogs:

- SWL-H190AB+ magnetic flux density: ON **0.16T** / OFF **0.008T** (measured per Sun Ai test protocol, test piece 100×100×10mm)
- SWL-H190AB clamping force: **150N or more** (Z-direction, test point at 100mm)
- SST-200 rotary pre-setter rotational accuracy: **0.002mm** vs. EROWA/system 3R master, size φ100/φ130 t60mm, weight 7.2kg
- SEP-02A(B) squareness (XY axes): within **0.003mm**; yawing per axis: **±0.001mm/150mm**
- SM standard chuck repeatability: **0.02mm**; positioning accuracy: **±0.02mm/100mm**
- STM electrode holder: world's only fine-pitch ball plunger on all products (2015); 20% easier adjustment than conventional products; EROWA and system 3R compatible

> **Spec consistency flag:** The SER-01A electrode rotator catalog lists rotational runout as "0.002以内" in Japanese and "～0.002" in English. Both indicate the same specification (within 0.002mm) but the tilde notation in the English version may cause confusion in international procurement documents. Specify as "≤0.002mm runout" in your RFQ.

## Summary

Three key takeaways for executives evaluating a magnetic chuck investment:

1. **The payback period is short.** A realistic model combining setup time reduction, demagnetizing elimination, and rework cost savings points to payback in under 12 months — often under 6 months for high-volume EDM operations.
    
2. **The technology is proven and awarded.** Sun Ai's SM-H series was tested at Iwate University and received the 中小企業庁長官賞, providing the third-party credibility needed for internal investment approval.
    
3. **Start small, scale fast.** A single SWL-H190AB on your busiest wire EDM is enough to generate measurable ROI data within one month — data you can use to justify system-wide adoption.
