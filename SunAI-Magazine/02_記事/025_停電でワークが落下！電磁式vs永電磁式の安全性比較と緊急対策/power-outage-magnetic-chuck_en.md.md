# Power Outage = Workpiece Drop! Electromagnetic vs Electro-Permanent Magnetic Chuck: Safety Comparison & Emergency Plan

## Overview

This article compares electromagnetic and electro-permanent magnetic chucks from a safety perspective, focusing on the critical risk of workpiece drop during a power outage. We present objective test data and explain the physical mechanisms that make electro-permanent types inherently safer — with no need for UPS systems.

## Intended Readers

- Factory managers and safety officers responsible for machining operations
- Equipment investment decision-makers evaluating risk management strategies
- Engineers operating EDM machines, surface grinders, or machining centers

## What You Will Learn

1. Why electromagnetic chucks lose all holding force instantly when power is cut
2. How electro-permanent magnetic chucks maintain grip without any electrical power
3. How to evaluate power-outage risk at your facility and select the right magnetic chuck

## Power Outage = Workpiece Drop! Electromagnetic vs Electro-Permanent: Safety Comparison & Emergency Plan

### 1. The Fatal Weakness of Electromagnetic Chucks: Zero Holding Force at Power Loss

Electromagnetic chucks generate holding force by passing electrical current through a coil. This mechanism is simple and cost-effective, but it has a fundamental safety vulnerability: **the moment power is interrupted, the magnetic field collapses and the workpiece is released immediately**.

In facilities that experience frequent power fluctuations — including planned outages common in China, India, and Southeast Asia — an electromagnetic chuck presents a serious accident risk. A workpiece weighing several kilograms falling from a grinder or EDM machine can cause severe injury and machine damage in an instant.

To counter this, many facilities install an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS). However, UPS equipment adds significant cost, requires maintenance, and only extends holding time — it does not eliminate the underlying risk.

### 2. The Electro-Permanent Mechanism: Physics That Protects Your Workpiece

Electro-permanent magnetic chucks — such as the Sun Ai **SWL-H190** series — operate on a fundamentally different principle. Magnetization is achieved with a brief electrical pulse, after which the magnetic state is locked in place by the permanent magnet material itself. **No continuous power is required to maintain holding force.**

Key performance data from Sun Ai's SWL-H190 series:

|Model|ON Holding Force|Magnetic Flux Density (ON)|Magnetic Flux Density (OFF)|
|---|---|---|---|
|SWL-H190AB|150 N or more|0.06 T|0.006 T|
|SWL-H190AB+|200 N (300 N)|0.16 T|0.008 T|
|SWL-H100αβ|150 N or more|0.06 T|0.006 T|

The SWL-H190AB+ achieves a magnetic flux density of **0.16 T** in the ON state, providing exceptional grip. Even when switched OFF, the residual magnetism is only **0.008 T** — low enough that it has virtually no influence on subsequent machining accuracy.

Critically, when a power outage occurs in the middle of machining, the chuck remains in whatever state it was last set to. If it was ON, the workpiece stays firmly clamped. **No UPS is needed.**

> **Safety Note:** The SWL-H190 series uses a patented demagnetization function (Patent No. 5716232) that eliminates the need for separate demagnetizing treatment after machining. The Underscore Set option reduces the work position to 0 mm, but narrows the clamping space to 2 mm. When using this option, extreme care must be taken during workpiece setup, as the reduced clamping space increases the risk of workpiece drop.

### 3. Power-Outage Risk Evaluation: Choosing the Right Chuck for Your Environment

Not all facilities carry the same power-outage risk. Use the matrix below to assess your situation:

|Outage Frequency|Outage Duration|Recommended Action|
|---|---|---|
|Rare (< 1x/year)|Short (< 1 min)|Evaluate UPS cost vs. electro-permanent upgrade|
|Occasional (monthly)|Medium (1–10 min)|Electro-permanent strongly recommended|
|Frequent (weekly+)|Long (10 min+)|Electro-permanent essential; UPS alone insufficient|

For facilities in China, India, and Southeast Asia where planned outages are routine, electro-permanent technology is not a luxury — it is a baseline safety requirement.

**Additional factors to consider:**

The SWL-H190 series requires no electrical wiring for installation and can begin clamping workpieces immediately after mounting on the machine. The maximum load capacity is 40 kg per set of two units. The unique L-design (Design Right No. 1666196) provides stable clamping for wire EDM applications.

For those needing higher holding power, the **SWL-H190AB+** offers more than twice the holding force of the standard model. For applications where a smaller footprint is required, the **SWL-H100αβ** provides the same electro-permanent safety in a more compact body.

### 4. Total Cost Comparison: Electro-Permanent vs. Electromagnetic + UPS

A common objection to electro-permanent magnetic chucks is their higher initial price compared to electromagnetic types. However, when the full cost of risk mitigation is considered, the picture changes significantly.

Electromagnetic chuck costs include: the chuck itself, a UPS system, UPS battery replacement (typically every 3–5 years), UPS maintenance, and residual risk that the UPS battery fails at a critical moment. Electro-permanent chucks from Sun Ai eliminate the UPS entirely and include demagnetization capability as standard — reducing both capital and operational expense while providing superior safety.

For small and medium manufacturers, this makes electro-permanent technology accessible not just as a safety upgrade, but as a rational investment with measurable ROI.

## Summary

Three key points to remember:

1. **Electromagnetic chucks drop workpieces the instant power is cut** — this is physics, not a design flaw that can be engineered away with maintenance.
2. **Sun Ai's SWL-H190 series maintains full clamping force during power outages** because holding force is stored in permanent magnet material, not in an electrical circuit.
3. **Electro-permanent magnetic chucks eliminate the need for UPS systems**, reducing both cost and residual risk — making them the rational choice for any facility where uptime and personnel safety are priorities.
