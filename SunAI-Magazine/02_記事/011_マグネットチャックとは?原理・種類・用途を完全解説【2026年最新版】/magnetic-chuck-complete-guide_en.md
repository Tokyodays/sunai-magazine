## What Is a Magnetic Chuck? Principles, Types & Applications — The Complete 2026 Guide

### 1. Why Magnetic Clamping Matters in Modern Precision Manufacturing

Scroll chucks and vises exert point or line forces on a workpiece. That clamping pressure deforms the part — sometimes by tens of microns — before a single cut is made. When the chuck releases, the workpiece springs back. The result: a part that looks accurate on the machine but measures out of tolerance on the CMM.

A magnetic chuck distributes holding force uniformly across the entire contact face. The workpiece is held flat, without deformation. After machining and demagnetization, it stays flat. That is why magnetic clamping is indispensable for achieving squareness, circularity, and flatness at the micron level.

Sun Ai's SM-H series demonstrates this concretely. University tribology testing at Iwate University (Associate Professor Yoshino, Engineering Department) showed that the SM-H's ON holding force is approximately twice that of conventional magnetic chucks, while its OFF residual magnetism drops to roughly one-fifth. Milling tests on S50C (70×80×10 mm, cutter φ40 mm, S1000/F200) confirmed that workpieces held with the SM-H series do not warp during cutting — the material-stress release that causes bowing in conventional fixturing is suppressed because the chuck holds the workpiece uniformly flat throughout the cut.

**Key specification note:** The SM-H series holds to 0.001 mm machining precision (surface pitch 3:11 at 4 mm, or 3:11 at 3 mm for SM-3H models). It carries patent 特許第5716232号 and was developed with support from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry's Monodukuri subsidy program. It also received the Tohoku Regional Invention Award and the SME Agency Commissioner's Award.

### 2. The Three Fundamental Magnetic Chuck Technologies

#### 2-1. Permanent Magnetic Chuck (永久磁石式)

Permanent magnetic chucks use rare-earth or ferrite permanent magnets arranged in an alternating pole pattern. Switching between ON and OFF is achieved mechanically — rotating a shaft shifts the magnet array so that flux either flows through the work surface (ON) or is short-circuited internally (OFF).

**Advantages:** No power supply required; no heat generation; no risk of workpiece release on power failure.

**Sun Ai products:** The SM standard series, SM-C cemented-carbide series, SM-S/SH/SWH circular series, and SM-P pallet series are all permanent-magnet designs.

_Representative SM standard series specifications:_

|Model|Size H×W×L (mm)|Weight (kg)|Holding Power — Center (kgf)|Residual (kgf)|Pole Pitch (Fe:Brass mm)|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|SM-0710|40×75×100|2.4|80|~3|2:1 (3)|
|SM-1530|40×150×300|12.3|110|~4|2:1 (3)|
|SM-2040|45×200×400|24.8|130|~5|2:1 (3)|
|SM-3040|45×300×400|43.0|130|~5|2:1 (3)|
|SM-5075|50×507×750|155.5|130|~5|2:1 (3)|

> Note: Prices revised from July 2025. Contact Sun Ai for current pricing.

The SM-UC series raises ON force to 1.5× the standard while reducing OFF residual to 1/10, making it suitable for steel workpieces that must not retain magnetism after machining.

The SM-CNO series maximizes ON field strength (center flux exceeding 4,000 Gauss on SM-CNO1112) for holding thin and small workpieces. **Important: SM-CNO has no OFF function. Remove wristwatches and precision instruments before operation.**

#### 2-2. Electromagnetic Chuck (電磁チャック)

Electromagnetic chucks energize a coil to create the holding field. Holding force is proportional to current and can be varied continuously — useful when fine control of clamping force is needed.

**Trade-off:** Requires a constant power supply; power failure releases the workpiece (mitigated by battery backup on modern controllers). Coil heating over long cycles can affect workpiece temperature and dimensional stability.

#### 2-3. Electro-Permanent Magnetic Chuck (永電磁チャック / エアー制御式)

The SWL-H190 series uses air pressure to switch magnetic state — combining the no-power-required retention of permanent magnets with push-button convenience.

Key performance data from Sun Ai's published test results:

|Model|ON Flux Density|OFF Flux Density|Clamping Force (100 mm test point)|
|---|---|---|---|
|SWL-H190AB+|0.16 T|0.008 T|200 N (300 N peak)|
|SWL-H190AB|0.06 T|0.006 T|150 N or more|
|SWL-H100αβ|0.06 T|0.006 T|150 N or more|

The SWL-H190 (100) clamps a workpiece in 1 second. It attaches directly to a wire EDM machine with no electrical wiring required — ready to machine immediately after mounting. Its built-in demagnetizing function (activated at OFF) eliminates the need for a separate demagnetizing step after machining. Patent 特許第5716232号; design registration 意匠登録1666196.

**Safety note:** When using the optional Underscore Set or spacers that reduce clamping space to 2 mm, the risk of workpiece falling increases. Extreme care must be taken when loading and positioning the workpiece.

### 3. Form Factor: Choosing the Right Shape

#### 3-1. Rectangular (角形) Magnetic Chucks

The workhorse format for surface grinders and EDM machines. Sun Ai's SM standard line covers a continuous size range from 75×100 mm (SM-0710) to 507×750 mm (SM-5075), ensuring coverage for any machine table.

For cemented carbide (超硬材) — which cannot be held by standard magnetic chucks — the SM-C series uses a specialized magnet arrangement that generates sufficient flux through non-ferrous carbide. The SM-UC sub-series further strengthens ON force to 1.5× standard while achieving a sharp OFF: steel workpieces release without residual magnetism. The SM-CNO sub-series maximizes ON-state flux for thin-part and small-part fixturing.

For cutting (milling) applications, the SM-H Hyper series features stronger ON force and cleaner OFF validated by university test data, enabling high-flatness machining on machining centers without the workpiece bowing that afflicts conventional vise fixturing.

#### 3-2. Circular (丸形) Magnetic Chucks

Turning and cylindrical grinding require round chucks. Scroll chucks deform round workpieces through jaw pressure; magnetic chucks do not.

Sun Ai's SM-S/SH/SWH/SW3H series covers diameters from φ123 mm to φ306 mm:

|Series|Application|Surface Pitch Options|
|---|---|---|
|SM-S|General grinding and EDM|1:2 (3 mm)|
|SM-SH|Cylindrical grinding (higher suction)|2:6 (8 mm) or 3:11 (14 mm)|
|SM-SWH|5-axis machining centers|3:11 (14 mm)|
|SM-SW3H|Thin workpieces (highest holding for thin parts)|1:2 (3 mm)|

All circular chucks are compatible with EROWA, GFMS, and Honma Multi Chuck pallet systems (on request). The SM-SH and SM-SWH series are also available as pallet types for robot-assisted workpiece exchange.

The circular pallet magnetic chuck (SM-SHP series) within the SM-P pallet line covers φ123 mm to φ302 mm and is ideal for cylindrical grinders, with holding forces up to 280 kgf.

#### 3-3. Sign Bar (サインバー) Magnetic Chucks

Sign bar chucks hold workpieces at precise angles for profile grinding, EDM at compound angles, and cemented-carbide angle machining. Sun Ai offers both integrated-type (SM-0710-SIN-MH, the world's smallest sign-bar magnetic chuck) and exchangeable-type (SM-○○○○-SIN-M8) designs.

The exchangeable SM-SIN-M8 family lets users select the magnetic chuck type — cemented-carbide (SM-C series chuck), cutting-compatible (SM-H series chuck), or standard grinding/EDM (SM-1015 chuck) — and mount it on the same sign bar base. This allows a single sign bar investment to serve multiple machining modes.

All sign bar products use a minus-start reference: a block gauge must be inserted to establish the zero datum. EROWA and system 3R compatibility is available as an option. Larger custom sizes are available on request.

#### 3-4. Pallet (パレット式) Magnetic Chucks

The SM-P series is Sun Ai's answer to the IoT connectivity challenge: "If different machining machines are not connected, it is not IoT."

When a workpiece must move from EDM to surface grinding to CMM without re-setup, the pallet chuck holds it securely throughout the journey. Re-presetting after each machine transfer reintroduces human error and consumes setup time. A compact, powerful pallet magnetic chuck eliminates both problems.

The SM-P series supports EROWA, system 3R, and Honma Multi Chuck pallet systems and covers a wide size range (55×55 mm to 300×300 mm for standard rectangular pallets, φ123 mm to φ302 mm for circular pallets). Four variants serve different needs:

- **Standard pallet (SM-P):** Best for EDM auto workpiece exchange; 60 kgf tensile test rating (SM-P1212 and smaller).
- **Milling-compatible pallet (SM-HP):** Strong holding power for medium milling; 340 kgf (SM-HP1520).
- **Circular pallet (SM-SHP):** For cylindrical grinders; 280 kgf.
- **Ejectable pallet (SM-PJ):** Jet-stream compatible; up to 3 center jets and 4 arm jets in X and Y directions.

### 4. Off-Machine Setup (外段取り): The Productivity Multiplier

No matter how fast the machine, productivity is capped by setup time. If a machining center stops while an operator adjusts an electrode or re-datums a workpiece, machine utilization falls — and with it, profitability.

The SEP-02A(B) electrode/workpiece pre-setter from Sun Ai makes external setup possible. The concept: "place it right next to the processing machine." Compact yet rigid, the SEP-02A(B) maintains precision over long service life.

Published productivity data: **20% or more productivity improvement** is achievable through systematic off-machine setup, with rapid return on investment. The SEP-02A(B) is compatible with multiple machining machines simultaneously, and its modular option system scales with the user's needs:

- **Digital counter (linear scale):** Measures X, Y, and Z simultaneously (or single-axis). Enables direct numerical confirmation of electrode offset and workpiece datum.
- **Rotary pre-setter SST-200:** Mounts on the SEP-02A(B) Z-plate. Provides 0.002 mm rotational runout for roundness measurement and electrode center adjustment. Compatible with EROWA and system 3R masters. Size: φ100 / φ130, t60 mm; weight: 7.2 kg.

Machine specifications of SEP-02A(B):

|Parameter|Value|
|---|---|
|Yawing per axis|±0.001 mm / 150 mm (Y: 140 mm)|
|Squareness XY|Within 0.003 mm|
|Table-to-Z squareness|Within 0.003 mm|
|Body weight|220 kg|
|Body size|Z1500 × Y650 × X450 mm|
|X/Y/Z stroke|150 mm / 140 mm / 150 mm|

### 5. Electrode Holders and Rotation Devices: Completing the EDM Ecosystem

A magnetic chuck holds the workpiece; the electrode holder positions the electrode. Sun Ai's STM series universal electrode holders are designed to work as a system with the SEP-02A(B) pre-setter.

**World's only fine-pitch ball plunger on all adjustment screws (as of 2015).** Conventional electrode holders use coarse-thread adjustment screws that exhibit backlash and return drift. Sun Ai's fine-pitch ball plunger design eliminates both problems, making adjustments 20% easier and fully repeatable.

The STM series covers a wide range of electrode weights, clamp types, and centering requirements:

|Model|Height (mm)|Width (mm)|Weight (kg)|Max Electrode Load (kg)|Centering Range|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|STM-05-AL (ultra-light)|48|φ68|0.7|5.0|—|
|STM-05|48|φ68|1.3|5.0|—|
|STM-10|50|φ92|2.2|15.0|—|
|STM-05-EYC|80|φ68|1.9|5.0|XY ±2.5 mm|
|STM-10-EYC|82|φ92|3.5|10.0|XY ±3.5 mm|

All models support ±2.5° vertical tilt and ±10.0° rotation adjustment. EYC variants add XY centering for cylindrical electrodes. All are EROWA and system 3R compatible (95% of world EDM tooling systems).

The STM-00-EYC series (world's smallest and lightest collet chuck electrode holder) and STM-00-MST series (MST collet compatible) add collet flexibility: EYCollet16/25/32 and MSTcollet10/20. These ultra-compact holders feature ±0.2 mm XY centering and ±1° tilt, weigh as little as 0.5 kg, and are jet-compatible for high-pressure coolant applications.

For EDM operations that require rotating the electrode — converting a sinker EDM into the equivalent of a jig grinder or small-hole EDM machine — the SER-01A electrode rotation device provides:

- Rotational runout: within 0.002 mm
- Speed range: 120–1,200 r/min
- Rated torque: 58 mN·m
- Body weight: approximately 4.5 kg (including motor)
- Chuck options: collet chuck or drill chuck
- Compatibility: EROWA or system 3R (selectable)

Comparative machining test results (φ18 mm bore, wire EDM vs. wire EDM + SER-01A finishing):

|Method|Circularity|Surface Roughness Ra|
|---|---|---|
|Wire EDM only|0.0044 mm|Ra 1.1646 μm|
|+ SER-01A electrode rotation|0.0015 mm|Ra 0.1279 μm|

Both circularity and surface roughness improve dramatically. The SER-01A turns a standard sinker EDM into a precision round-hole finishing machine without additional capital investment.

### 6. Cross Tables (クロステーブル): Expanding the Machining Range

The SCT-2301 and SCT-3400 cross tables are described as "the only cross tables in the world that can be attached to a processing machine." They are adopted by well-known machine tool manufacturers.

Despite their low cost and lightweight thin-body construction, they achieve genuine precision:

|Specification|Value|
|---|---|
|Table flatness|300 mm / 0.02 mm|
|Straightness|300 mm / 0.02 mm|
|XY squareness|300 mm / 0.02 mm|
|Positioning accuracy|100 mm / ±0.02 mm|
|Repeatability|0.02 mm|
|T-slot width|10 mm|
|Lead screw pitch|4 mm (30° trapezoidal)|

SCT-2301 table size: 350×250 mm; stroke X300/Y200 mm. SCT-3400 table size: 450×350 mm; stroke X400/Y300 mm.

## まとめ

Three key takeaways:

1. **Magnetic clamping is the foundation of micron-level precision.** Uniform holding force prevents workpiece deformation during cutting, grinding, and EDM — achieving squareness, circularity, and flatness impossible with mechanical fixturing.
    
2. **The right magnetic chuck depends on workpiece material, machine type, and automation level.** Sun Ai's lineup spans standard grinding (SM series), cemented carbide (SM-C series), high-performance milling (SM-H series), circular turning (SM-S/SH/SWH series), sign bar angle machining, pallet-based IoT connectivity (SM-P series), and air-switched EDM clamping (SWL-H190 series).
    
3. **Off-machine setup (外段取り) is the highest-leverage productivity investment.** The SEP-02A(B) pre-setter with optional SST-200 rotary pre-setter and digital counters enables 20%+ productivity gains with a modest capital outlay — the first step toward lights-out manufacturing.

## 制作メモ

**仕様の不整合確認:**

- SM-C series catalog lists SM-C2114 (140×225×53 mm, work area 120×150 mm, 13 kg) but the magnetchuck_2025.pdf lineup page lists SM-C2214. The dimensional data appears correct for the 140×225 mm body — this may be a model number typo in the catalog. Flagged for verification before publication.
- The SER-01A catalog states "回転数120〜1200r/min" and separately lists "runout rotation axis ~0.002" without a unit; context and SST-200 cross-reference confirm the unit is mm (0.002 mm).
- SCT cross table catalog contains a typo: "anywheere" (should be "anywhere") and "peocessing" (should be "processing") in the English text. These are catalog OCR/typo errors, not specification errors.
- SM-P series tensile test piece is listed as □50×50 mm at 60 kgf (SM-P0505 to SM-P1212 range) and 80 kgf (SM-P1015 and larger). The milling-compatible SM-HP series lists 340 kgf for SM-HP1520. These values represent different test conditions and should not be directly compared.
