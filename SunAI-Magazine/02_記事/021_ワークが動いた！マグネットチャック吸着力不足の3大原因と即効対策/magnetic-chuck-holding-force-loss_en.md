## 021 Workpiece Slipped! 3 Root Causes of Magnetic Chuck Holding Force Loss & Emergency Solutions

### 1. Why Holding Force Loss Is So Dangerous

When a workpiece moves during grinding or EDM machining, the consequences cascade fast: a ruined surface finish, a scrapped workpiece, broken tooling, or — in the worst case — a workpiece ejected from the chuck entirely. The frustrating reality is that holding force loss is rarely random. In the vast majority of cases, one of three well-defined root causes is responsible.

Understanding those causes is the difference between guessing and fixing.

### 2. The 3 Root Causes — Diagnosed and Explained

#### Cause 1: Oil Film and Coolant Contamination on the Chuck Surface

An oil or coolant film between the workpiece and the chuck surface acts as a non-magnetic insulating layer. Even a film thickness of a few microns is enough to dramatically reduce the effective contact area and therefore the holding force.

**How to identify it:** Wipe the chuck surface and the workpiece seating face with a clean cloth and attempt to re-chuck. If holding force is restored immediately, oil contamination was the cause.

**Emergency corrective action:** Clean both surfaces with a degreasing agent before every chucking operation. Confirm that coolant is not pooling on the chuck surface during machining. For high-coolant-volume operations, consider a chuck model with jet-compatible design (Sun Ai SM-P series pallet-type magnetic chucks include jet-compatible configurations in the SM-PJ lineup).

> **Safety note:** When using the offset bar and spacer options on the SWL-H190 series, the clamping space reduces to as little as 2 mm. In this configuration, the risk of workpiece drop increases significantly. Extreme care must be taken when setting the workpiece.

---

#### Cause 2: Foreign Material Contamination (Chips, Swarf, Scale)

Metallic chips or swarf trapped between the workpiece and the chuck surface create localized air gaps, dramatically reducing the effective magnetic contact area. Even a single chip 0.05 mm thick under a corner of the workpiece can cause a measurable drop in holding force.

**How to identify it:** Remove the workpiece and inspect the chuck surface and workpiece seating face for chips or debris under bright light. Check the magnetic pole pitch spacing (Sun Ai SM series standard pitch: 2:1 ratio, steel:brass, 3 mm pitch on smaller models) — chips can lodge in the inter-pole grooves.

**Emergency corrective action:** Use a brass or plastic scraper (never steel) to clear the pole grooves. Blow out with compressed air. For EDM applications, the SM-H series hyper magnetic chucks were specifically tested for resistance to swarf contamination — University of Iwate tribology tests confirm that slag and chips wipe off easily with a cloth due to the chuck's surface design, and the waterproof construction means chips do not penetrate.

---

#### Cause 3: Magnetic Degradation (Residual Magnetism Reduction Over Time)

Permanent magnetic chucks lose a small fraction of their holding force with each thermal cycle, mechanical shock, or exposure to demagnetizing fields from nearby EDM equipment. Cumulative degradation can reach a point where nominal holding force can no longer be sustained.

**How to identify it:** Compare current holding force measurement against catalog values. Sun Ai's SM series specifies holding force in kgf at a 50×50 mm test piece. For example, the SM-1530 rates 110 kgf at center and 35 kgf at corners. If your measurement falls below 80% of catalog value, magnetic degradation is likely.

**Emergency corrective action:** On switchable permanent-magnet chucks (SM-C, SM-UC, SM-H series), check the ON/OFF switching mechanism — a sticking or worn mechanism can prevent full ON-state magnetic alignment. For the SM-UC series, note that ON-state strength is 1.5× the standard product while OFF-state residual is 1/10, making these chucks suitable for use with steel workpieces where residual magnetism is a concern.

For the SWL-H190 series electro-permanent chucks used in wire EDM clamping, the demagnetizing function is built into the OFF cycle (Patent No. 5716232). This eliminates post-machining demagnetization treatment entirely — magnetic force during machining is confirmed to be virtually zero based on Gauss measurement data (maximum ~18 Gauss at installation surface corners, effectively zero at center).

### 3. The Rapid Diagnostic Checklist (Under 5 Minutes)

Work through this checklist in order:

**Step 1 — Visual & tactile check (1 min)** Clean and wipe the chuck surface and workpiece seat. Re-chuck and test. If holding force is restored → Cause 1 (oil film). Stop here and implement Cause 1 corrective actions.

**Step 2 — Foreign material inspection (2 min)** With the workpiece removed, inspect all pole grooves under bright light. Run a fingernail across the surface to detect lodged chips. If debris is found → Cause 2 (swarf contamination). Proceed with Cause 2 corrective actions and recheck.

**Step 3 — Holding force measurement (2 min)** Using a pull gauge on a 50×50 mm steel test piece, measure holding force and compare against catalog specifications. If below 80% of catalog value and Steps 1–2 found no issue → Cause 3 (magnetic degradation). Contact Sun Ai for evaluation and next steps.

### 4. Choosing the Right Chuck to Prevent Recurrence

Selecting the correct chuck for your application eliminates many of these problems before they occur.

**For grinding of cemented carbide (超硬材):** Sun Ai's SM-C series permanent-magnet chucks are specifically designed for cemented carbide precision grinding. The SM-UC sub-series offers ON-state strength 1.5× the standard product and OFF-state residual of just 1/10 — critical when cemented carbide workpieces must be released cleanly. Push-up pins (standard on SM-C1580 and SM-C1009V) allow positive workpiece ejection.

**For milling and machining center operations:** The SM-H series (Hyper Magnetic Chuck) was developed in collaboration with Iwate University tribology research. Milling test data (S50C material, 70×80×10 mm workpiece, 0.3 mm depth of cut at S1000/F200) shows that workpiece flatness error with SM-H3 fixturing is dramatically reduced versus a conventional vise: warp values drop from a range of −10 to +12 microns (conventional) to +1 to +8 microns (SM-H3). The SM-H series is also EROWA and system 3R compatible (option).

**For wire EDM clamping:** The SWL-H190 series uses air pressure to control magnetic force, requires no electrical wiring, and installs in one second with workpiece clamping confirmed in one second as well. The patented L-design (Design Registration No. 1666196) provides a unique clamping geometry. Magnetic flux density: SWL-H190AB+ ON: 0.16T, OFF: 0.008T. Maximum load capacity: 40 kg per set of 2 units.

**For cross-machine workpiece transfer (IoT-compatible automation):** Sun Ai's SM-P pallet-type magnetic chuck series enables workpieces to be transferred between EDM machines, surface grinders, machining centers, and CMMs while remaining clamped — eliminating the need to re-preset after each machine transfer. Compatible with EROWA, system 3R, and Honma Multi Chuck systems. This is the practical first step in connecting different processing machines, which is a prerequisite for true IoT-based manufacturing automation.

## まとめ

When a workpiece moves during machining, the cause is almost always one of three things: oil film contamination reducing magnetic contact, swarf lodged in the pole grooves creating air gaps, or cumulative magnetic degradation below the functional threshold. The five-minute diagnostic checklist above narrows the cause systematically. Selecting the right chuck for the application — with appropriate ON/OFF switching capability, residual magnetism specs, and surface pitch matched to the workpiece material — eliminates most recurrence risk before it starts.

## 制作メモ

**仕様の不整合確認:**

- SWL-H190AB+ clamping force: catalog states 200N (300N) — the parenthetical "300N" likely refers to a higher-load condition or test variation. Use "200N or more" for conservative technical claims.
- SM-C1530 is referenced in the catalog note but does not appear in the main product table (SM-C1580 is the closest standard model). Confirmed: the note references SM-C1530 in relation to ON/OFF lever selection — this may be an alternate designation or catalog update item. Use SM-C1580 in article claims.
- SM-CNO series has NO ON/OFF function — this is clearly noted in the catalog and must not be implied otherwise.
- Magnetic flux density figures (SWL-H190AB+ 0.16T ON, 0.008T OFF) are from catalog test results and are consistent.

**独自ノウハウの抽出:**

- SWL-H190 series: built-in demagnetization on OFF cycle eliminates post-process demagnetization step (Patent 5716232) — significant competitive differentiator
- SM-H series: Iwate University tribology collaboration provides third-party data credibility
- SM-UC series 1.5×/1/10 ON/OFF ratio is a distinctive spec not commonly found in standard chucks
- Pallet chuck system for cross-machine transfer without re-presetting is a key IoT-enabler
- All SM-CNO series products have no OFF function — must wear no precision instruments during operation
