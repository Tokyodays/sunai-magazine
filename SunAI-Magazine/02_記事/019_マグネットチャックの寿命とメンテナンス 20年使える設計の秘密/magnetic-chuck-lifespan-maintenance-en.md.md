### 1. Why Magnetic Chuck Lifespan Matters for Your Bottom Line

When evaluating workholding equipment, the sticker price is only part of the story. A hydraulic chuck may appear affordable up front, yet require full replacement every 5–7 years due to seal fatigue, oil leaks, and wear of dynamic components. A permanent magnetic chuck from Sun Ai, by contrast, has no hydraulic circuits, no electrical wiring, and no moving mechanical parts that wear under cyclic load. This fundamental difference in design philosophy is what makes a service life of 15–20 years not just possible, but routine among Sun Ai customers.

The Sun Ai SM Series and SM-H Series magnetic chucks carry the distinction of zero reported failures since their release—a record the company highlights as a direct result of design choices made at the material and structural level. Understanding those choices helps maintenance teams protect that record and helps procurement teams justify the investment with confidence.

### 2. The Three Primary Degradation Factors

**2-1. Magnetic Flux Density Reduction**

The permanent magnets in a Sun Ai chuck are rated for very high flux density. Test data for the SWL-H190AB+ model shows an ON-state flux density of 0.16 T, while the SWL-H190AB and SWL-H100αβ models measure 0.06 T ON. These values reflect the strength available to hold workpieces during machining.

Magnetic output can decline over decades if the chuck is repeatedly subjected to heat above the magnet's Curie threshold, mechanical shock that fractures magnet material, or prolonged exposure to opposing magnetic fields (reverse magnetization). In practice, operating temperatures inside a grinding or EDM environment rarely approach the Curie point of rare-earth or ferrite magnets, so thermal degradation is uncommon under normal use. The more realistic risk is mechanical impact—dropping the chuck or striking it with a heavy workpiece.

Practical mitigation: Handle the chuck with care during setup changes. When using the SM-CNO series (which has no OFF function and generates a central flux density exceeding 4,000 Gauss), always remove wristwatches and precision instruments before working near the unit, as noted in the Sun Ai catalog safety instructions.

**2-2. Working Surface Wear and Flatness Loss**

The working surface (table parallelism, straight-line movement, and XY squareness) is the reference datum for every workpiece held on the chuck. Sun Ai standard magnetic chucks specify table parallelism at 300 mm / 0.02 mm and repeatability at 0.02 mm. As the surface accumulates micro-scratches from swarf, workpiece edges, and grinding debris, the effective contact area for magnetic force decreases and workpiece positioning accuracy degrades.

Proactive surface maintenance—regular cleaning of the pole pitch grooves, removal of embedded metallic particles, and periodic resurfacing when flatness exceeds the tolerance band—preserves both holding force and dimensional accuracy. The SM-H Series is noted for its waterproof construction that resists coolant intrusion, and its slag and swarf can be wiped off easily with a cloth, reducing the effort required for routine cleaning.

**2-3. ON/OFF Mechanism and Residual Magnetism**

The Sun Ai SM Series uses a lever-operated permanent magnet switching mechanism (ON/OFF Hand Torque rated at 20–250 kg·cm depending on model). Unlike electro-magnetic chucks that require a power supply, this mechanism operates entirely without electricity—a key advantage that eliminates wiring-related failure modes. However, the lever pivot and cam surfaces experience wear over millions of switching cycles.

Residual magnetism after switching OFF is a separate concern. SM Series standard models show residual flux of approximately ≤5 Kgf (test piece 50×50 mm). The SWL-H190AB+ model retains slightly more residual magnetism (OFF: 0.008 T) compared to the SWL-H190AB (OFF: 0.006 T), trading some demagnetization performance for its higher holding power (200–300 N clamping force). For applications where post-machining demagnetization is critical—such as EDM where residual magnetism can attract iron particles to the finished bore—the SWL-H190 series incorporates a built-in demagnetizing function (Patent No. 5716232), eliminating the need for a separate demagnetizer. This patented feature is one of the most operationally significant differentiators in the Sun Ai lineup.

### 3. Recommended Maintenance Schedule

The following schedule is derived from Sun Ai product documentation and best practices for precision workholding. Adjust intervals based on machine utilization and environmental conditions.

**Daily (every shift)**

Clean the working surface with a non-abrasive wipe to remove swarf and coolant residue. Verify the ON/OFF lever operates smoothly. Confirm the workpiece seats flush before commencing machining. When using the SWL-H190(100) series, note that the clamping space with optional spacers is reduced to 2 mm—exercise extreme care when positioning the workpiece to prevent the risk of the workpiece falling, as explicitly noted in the Sun Ai catalog safety caution.

**Monthly**

Measure holding force using a calibrated pull-gauge against a standard 50×50 mm test piece. Compare results to the specification table (e.g., SM-2040 center holding force: 130 Kgf). A reduction of more than 15% from baseline warrants investigation. Inspect pole pitch grooves for embedded metallic particles; clean with a brass brush. Check the ON/OFF lever torque against catalog values.

**Annually**

Verify surface flatness with a dial gauge or precision flat. For chucks used in grinding applications, a light surface regrind to restore flatness within 0.02 mm / 300 mm is typically sufficient and can be performed by the operator. Measure residual magnetism at the center of the chuck (the standard measurement point per Sun Ai documentation) using a Gauss meter. For the SM-H Series, inspect the waterproofing at edge seals.

**Every 5 Years**

Conduct a full magnetic flux density survey across the working surface using a surface flux density measurement instrument. Sun Ai internal testing demonstrates that a well-maintained chuck shows clearly delineated ON/OFF contrast—strong ON, clearly weak OFF—confirming both magnet integrity and switching mechanism performance. Document results and compare to the original factory acceptance data.

### 4. Lifespan Benchmarks and TCO Analysis

The table below compares the Total Cost of Ownership over a 20-year horizon for three common workholding categories. Figures are illustrative and should be validated against actual pricing and utilization data for your facility.

|Cost Category|Permanent Magnetic Chuck (Sun Ai SM Series)|Hydraulic Chuck|Electro-Magnetic Chuck|
|---|---|---|---|
|Initial unit cost|Medium|Low–Medium|Medium–High|
|Expected service life|15–20 years|5–7 years|8–12 years|
|Replacement cycles (20 yr)|1 unit|3–4 units|2 units|
|Power / air requirement|None|Hydraulic unit required|Constant power required|
|Wiring / plumbing|None|Hydraulic lines|Power cable + controller|
|Post-machining demagnetization|Built-in (SWL series)|N/A|Separate unit required|
|Operator setup time|1 second (SWL-H190)|10–30 seconds|5–15 seconds|
|Maintenance labor (annual est.)|Low|High (seal replacement, oil changes)|Medium|
|Failure-since-launch record|Zero (SM Series)|Not applicable|Not applicable|

The SEP-02A(B) electrode/workpiece pre-setter catalog documents a measured productivity improvement of more than 20% when off-line setup (外段取り) is adopted. While the SEP-02A(B) is a pre-setter rather than a chuck, its documentation illustrates the broader principle that reducing machine downtime—which a permanent magnetic chuck supports through fast, tool-free clamping—delivers compounding returns that dwarf the initial purchase price over a 20-year horizon.

For a plant running two shifts, 250 days per year, a 1-second clamp time versus a 20-second hydraulic setup cycle on 50 workpiece changes per shift saves approximately 550 operator-hours per year per machine. At a conservative labor rate, the payback period for the incremental cost of a Sun Ai magnetic chuck over a hydraulic alternative is typically measured in months, not years.

### 5. Signals That Your Chuck Has Reached End of Life

Replace or refurbish the chuck when any of the following conditions are confirmed and cannot be resolved through maintenance:

The holding force measured with a calibrated test piece falls below 80% of the catalog specification after cleaning and surface restoration. The working surface cannot be returned to within 0.03 mm flatness after resurfacing. The ON/OFF lever requires torque more than 20% above the catalog value (indicating wear in the switching cam). Flux density in the OFF state exceeds twice the catalog residual value, indicating demagnetization performance has degraded. Visible cracking or chipping of the surface steel laminations.

## まとめ

The 15–20 year service life of a Sun Ai permanent magnetic chuck is not a marketing claim—it is the result of a no-power, no-wiring, no-hydraulics design that eliminates the failure modes responsible for premature replacement in competing technologies. Maintaining this lifespan requires disciplined daily cleaning, monthly force verification, and annual flatness measurement. When these steps are followed, the TCO advantage over hydraulic or electro-magnetic alternatives is substantial: fewer replacement units, zero energy consumption, and labor savings that compound year over year. The zero-failure record of the SM Series since launch is the strongest available evidence that the design delivers on its promise.
