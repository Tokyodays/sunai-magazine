# Power Outage Safety: Why Electro-Permanent Magnetic Chucks Are the Smart Choice in Emerging Markets

## 概要

In regions where planned power outages and voltage fluctuations of ±15% are everyday realities, conventional electromagnetic chucks pose a catastrophic risk: when power fails, the workpiece falls. This article quantifies that risk, compares it against the electro-permanent design of Sun Ai's magnetic chuck lineup, and shows why factories in China, Southeast Asia, India, and Mexico are shifting to a safer, more cost-effective solution.

### 1. The Hidden Risk Inside Every Electromagnetic Chuck

Walk through any precision machining shop in inland China or industrial India, and you will encounter a risk that rarely appears on equipment specification sheets: power instability. Planned grid outages (scheduled blackouts that can last two to eight hours), combined with voltage swings of ±15% or more, make electromagnetic chucks a liability rather than an asset.

An electromagnetic chuck requires continuous electrical current to maintain magnetic holding force. The moment power is interrupted—even for a fraction of a second—holding force drops to zero. A workpiece weighing several kilograms, held at grinding-machine speed or positioned precisely for electrical discharge machining (EDM), becomes a projectile.

The consequences are measurable:

|Incident Type|Estimated Damage Cost|
|---|---|
|Workpiece damage only|$3,000–$15,000|
|Spindle/table collision|$15,000–$50,000|
|Machine structural damage|$50,000–$150,000|
|Production line shutdown (per day)|$5,000–$30,000|

Beyond direct repair costs, a single workpiece-drop incident can trigger quality holds across an entire production batch, damage customer relationships, and generate regulatory scrutiny in industries with strict traceability requirements such as automotive and aerospace.

### 2. What "Electro-Permanent" Actually Means

Sun Ai's magnetic chuck lineup—including the SWL-H190AB, SWL-H190AB+, SWL-H100αβ, SM-H Series, and SM-C Series—is built on an electro-permanent design. Understanding the mechanism clarifies why it is inherently safer in unstable power environments.

An electro-permanent magnetic chuck uses a brief pulse of electricity to switch its internal magnet state between ON and OFF. Once switched ON, the permanent magnet material maintains full holding force indefinitely with zero power consumption. No continuous current is required. A power outage has no effect on holding force whatsoever.

**Key performance data from Sun Ai catalog testing:**

|Model|Magnetic Flux Density (ON)|Magnetic Flux Density (OFF)|Clamping Force|
|---|---|---|---|
|SWL-H190AB+|0.16 T|0.008 T|200 N (300 N peak)|
|SWL-H190AB|0.06 T|0.006 T|150 N or more|
|SWL-H100αβ|0.06 T|0.006 T|150 N or more|

The SWL-H190AB+ achieves a measured magnetic flux density of 0.16 T in the ON state. Even after switching OFF, residual magnetism is only 0.008 T—low enough that machining is unaffected. For operations where near-zero residual magnetism is critical, the SWL-H190AB and SWL-H100αβ reduce the OFF value to 0.006 T.

Crucially, the SWL-H190 series incorporates a demagnetizing function (特許第5716232号 / Patent No. 5716232). When the chuck is switched OFF, an active demagnetization pulse is applied, eliminating the need for a separate demagnetizing operation after machining. This not only prevents iron particle contamination on finished workpieces but also removes an entire process step from the operator's workflow.

### 3. No Wiring Required: A Practical Advantage for Emerging Market Factories

Sun Ai's SWL-H190 series is designed to be attached to a processing machine and used immediately—no electrical wiring is required for normal operation. In environments where electrical infrastructure is unreliable, or where floor layout changes are frequent, this is a substantial operational advantage. Workers do not need electrician support to relocate or reconfigure chucks.

The unique L-shaped clamping design (意匠登録第1666196号 / Design Right No. 1666196) enables workpiece clamping in as little as one second. In off-site setup (外段取り) workflows, where workpieces are prepared away from the machining zone to keep machines running, this speed directly reduces setup time and increases spindle uptime.

Maximum load capacity reaches 40 kg when two units are used as a set—sufficient for the majority of wire EDM and surface grinding applications.

### 4. The SM-H Series: University-Verified Performance for Milling Applications

For factories running machining centers that require both high holding force and rapid workpiece exchange, the SM-H Series (Hyper magnetic chuck series) offers a step up in capability. Key verified performance data:

- Holding force ON state: approximately 2× that of conventional magnetic chucks (Iwate University measurement, SS400 material, n=50 average)
- Holding force OFF state: approximately 1/5 (80% reduction) compared to conventional products
- Compatible with EROWA and system 3R chucking systems (optional)
- Waterproof design: swarf and cutting fluid can be wiped away with a cloth

The SM-H Series was developed with support from Japan's national manufacturing subsidy program (国のものづくり補助金) and has been evaluated by the Tribology Laboratory of Iwate University's Engineering Department. Milling tests (S50C material, φ40mm cutter, S1000 rpm, F200) demonstrated that when SM-3H is used as the workpiece holder, flatness deviation is dramatically reduced compared to standard vise clamping—a direct result of suppressing workpiece warping during cutting.

**Practical note on safety:** When using optional spacers to lower workpiece height, the clamping space narrows. As explicitly noted in Sun Ai's catalog, a reduced clamping space increases workpiece fall risk. Extreme care must be taken during workpiece placement and removal in these configurations.

### 5. The SM-C Series: Precision Cemented Carbide Holding

For factories processing cemented carbide (超硬材)—common in tool and die production across China and Southeast Asia—the SM-C Series addresses a specific challenge: conventional magnetic chucks cannot hold non-ferrous cemented carbide workpieces with adequate force.

The SM-C and SM-UC series provide ON/OFF switching capability. The SM-UC series delivers ON-state force 1.5× greater than the standard SM-C, while the OFF state is reduced to 1/10 of standard—making it practical for steel workpieces as well.

**SM-CNO series caution:** The SM-CNO series has no ON/OFF function. Operators must remove precision instruments such as wristwatches before working near these units. This safety requirement should be incorporated into factory SOPs.

### 6. Selecting the Right Model for Your Application

|Application|Recommended Product|Key Advantage|
|---|---|---|
|Wire EDM, surface grinding (standard)|SWL-H190AB / SWL-H190AB+|No wiring, 1-second clamping, patent demagnetization|
|Machining center, 24-hour unmanned|SM-H Series|High ON force, low OFF force, robot-compatible|
|Cemented carbide grinding|SM-C / SM-UC Series|Holds non-ferrous carbide, ON/OFF switchable|
|Cylindrical grinding, multi-machine pallet transfer|SM-S / SM-SH / SM-SWH Series|Circular form, EROWA/GFMS/Honma Multi Chuck compatible|
|IoT/automation: multi-machine workpiece transfer|SM-P Series (Pallet type)|Works across EDM, surface grinder, machining center, CMM|

The SM-P pallet-type magnetic chuck series is specifically designed for factories implementing inter-machine automation. Compatible with EROWA, system 3R, and Honma Multi Chuck standards, the SM-P enables a workpiece held on the chuck to be transferred directly between different machine types without re-clamping—eliminating the human re-setup step that defeats the purpose of automation.

### 7. Off-Site Setup (外段取り): The Productivity Foundation

Regardless of which magnetic chuck is selected, the productivity gain is fully realized only when off-site setup (外段取り) is implemented systematically. Sun Ai's SEP-02A(B) electrode/workpiece pre-setter is designed with the concept of being placed immediately adjacent to the processing machine, minimizing transport distance and allowing setup work to proceed while the machine continues cutting.

SEP-02A(B) specifications relevant to precision setup:

- Yawing of each axis: ±0.001 mm / 150 mm (Y: 140 mm)
- Squareness between X and Y axes: within 0.003 mm
- Perpendicularity between table surface and Z axis: within 0.003 mm
- Compatible with the SST-200 rotary pre-setter (rotation runout within 0.002 mm)

When the SST-200 rotation pre-setter is mounted on the SEP-02A(B), total runout and squareness of the entire workpiece can be verified to 0.002 mm—without stopping the machining process. This is the operational definition of 外段取り: setup work that proceeds in parallel with machining.

Documented productivity impact: 20% or more productivity improvement, with rapid return on investment accessible even for small and medium enterprises.
