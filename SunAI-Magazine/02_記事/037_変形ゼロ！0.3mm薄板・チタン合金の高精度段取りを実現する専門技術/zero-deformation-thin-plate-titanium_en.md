# Zero Deformation! Specialized Techniques for High-Precision Setup of 0.3mm Thin Plates & Titanium Alloys

## 概要

Conventional vise and scroll chuck clamping deforms thin plates and hard-to-machine materials, making it impossible to achieve true squareness, circularity, or flatness. This article explains how Sun Ai's permanent magnetic chuck technology—combined with systematic off-site setup using the SEP-02A(B) pre-setter—delivers near-zero deformation. Measured data (circularity improving from 0.0044mm with wire EDM alone to 0.0015mm after electrode rotating device finishing) and material-specific clamping guidance are provided.

## 037 Zero Deformation! Specialized Techniques for High-Precision Setup of 0.3mm Thin Plates & Titanium Alloys

### 1. The Root Cause of Deformation: Uneven Clamping Force

When a thin plate (0.3–1mm) or a soft difficult-to-machine material such as titanium is gripped in a vise or scroll chuck, the localized jaw pressure warps the workpiece before a single cut is taken. After machining, the part springs back—carrying dimensional errors that no amount of finishing can recover.

**Scroll chuck jaw pressure** is particularly problematic for round workpieces. The three contact points create unequal radial forces that distort the blank. Sun Ai's SM-S and SM-SH circular magnetic chuck series eliminates this by holding the entire flat face of the workpiece with a uniform magnetic field, targeting squareness, circularity, and flatness of zero (直角度・真円度・平面度0). Because the clamping force is distributed across the full contact area rather than concentrated at jaws, the workpiece is not stressed prior to cutting.

For flat plate work—including 0.3mm-class ultra-thin materials—the SM-H Hyper Magnetic Chuck Series provides ON-state holding strength approximately twice that of conventional products, while OFF-state residual magnetism drops to roughly 1/5 of the conventional level (measured by Iwate Industrial Technology Center, test piece 10mm×60mm×t10mm, SS400, n=50 average). This near-zero residual magnetism means iron particles do not cling to the finished surface after demagnetization, eliminating one of the most common sources of post-process contamination.

> **Specification note:** The SM-H series holds workpieces with strong ON and very weak OFF—a critical distinction from standard magnetic chucks. The SM-UC series similarly delivers ON strength 1.5 times the standard product with OFF strength reduced to 1/10.

### 2. Material-Specific Chuck Selection

**Cemented carbide (超硬材):** Use the SM-C series permanent magnetic chucks. Standard models such as SM-C1580, SM-C1810, and SM-C2214 include ON/OFF switching and optional push-up pins for punch grinding. The SM-UC series upgrades ON force by 1.5× while reducing residual magnetism to 1/10—ideal when both strong clamping and clean release are required. Note: SM-CNO series has no OFF function; keep precision instruments away from the workpiece during operation.

**Thin and small workpieces:** The SM-CNO series generates the strongest ON magnetic field in the lineup (center region MAX 4000 Gauss measured for SM-CNO1112) and excels at holding thin chips and small blanks that would slide under cutting forces. Because there is no OFF function, the SM-CNO requires extra attention to demagnetization after use.

**Round workpieces (lathe, cylindrical grinder):** The SM-S, SM-SH, SM-SWH, and SM-SW3H circular series hold round blanks without jaw distortion. The SM-SH series (ø123–306mm) is recommended for cylindrical grinding; the SM-SWH series is optimized for 5-axis machines. All are available with optional EROWA, GFMS, and Honma Multi Chuck interfaces.

**Milling and machining center use:** The SM-H series has been university-tested (Iwate University, Yoshino Laboratory, tribology specialist) for milling cutting forces. In a 0.3mm milling test on S50C (70×80×t10mm, φ40mm cutter, S1000/F200), flatness deviation with a standard vise reached ±12 microns; with SM-3H fixturing it was reduced to +8 microns maximum—a dramatic improvement in parallelism and workpiece height uniformity.

**Wire EDM and air-controlled clamping:** For wire EDM machines, the SWL-H190 series (patent 5716232) uses air to switch the magnetic field, clamping a workpiece in 1 second. No electrical wiring is required—simply attach to the machine and begin cutting. The built-in demagnetization function activates at OFF, eliminating the need for a separate demagnetizer after processing. The SWL-H190AB+ achieves 0.16T ON / 0.008T OFF (magnetic flux density test results); the standard SWL-H190AB achieves 0.06T ON / 0.006T OFF. The unique L-design (design right 1666196) and clamp force test results (200N for SWL-H190AB+, 150N or more for SWL-H190AB) confirm reliable holding even during wire cutting turbulence.

> **Safety notice:** When using offset bars and spacers to lower workpiece height, the clamping space can be reduced to 2mm. At this reduced clamping space, the risk of workpiece falling increases significantly. Extreme care must be taken when setting the workpiece.

### 3. Achieving Micron-Level Circularity: The Role of Off-Site Setup

Even the best magnetic chuck cannot compensate for an electrode or workpiece that is not precisely centered and square before entering the EDM machine. This is where **off-site setup (外段取り)** becomes essential.

**What is off-site setup?** Off-site setup means performing all presetting, alignment, and measurement tasks outside the machining zone—with the machine running uninterrupted—so that when a new electrode or workpiece is loaded, it is already qualified to tolerance. Sun Ai's SEP-02A(B) Super Precision Electrode/Workpiece Pre-Setter was designed around the principle of "place it right next to the processing machine." Its compact footprint (Z1500mm × Y650mm × X450mm, 220kg) allows installation adjacent to EDM machines, machining centers, and CMMs—keeping the setup path as short as a river's flow.

**Measured improvement with the electrode rotating device (SER-01A):** A comparative test on φ18mm wire-EDM holes demonstrated that wire EDM alone produced a circularity of 0.0044mm and surface roughness Ra1.1646μm. After adding the SER-01A electrode rotating device (rotation runout within 0.002mm, speed range 120–1200 r/min, rated torque 58mN·m), the same hole achieved circularity of 0.0015mm and Ra0.1279μm—a 66% improvement in circularity and a 9× improvement in surface roughness. Circularity measurement was performed on a Zeiss UPMC-850; surface roughness on an Accretech Surfcom 1900sd3.

**The SST-200 Rotary Pre-setter:** The SST-200 mounts on top of the SEP-02A(B) and achieves rotational runout within 0.002mm against EROWA and system 3R masters. Size φ100/φ130 × t60mm, weight 7.2kg. By combining the SEP-02A(B) and SST-200, total runout and squareness of electrodes and workpieces can be verified and corrected before the machine is loaded—eliminating mid-process interruptions.

**SEP-02A(B) precision specifications:**

- Yawing of each axis: ±0.001mm / 150mm (Y: 140mm)
- XY-axis squareness: within 0.003mm
- Table surface to Z-axis perpendicularity: within 0.003mm
- X/Y/Z stroke: 150mm / 140mm / 150mm
- Compatible with system 3R and EROWA tooling systems

### 4. Off-Site Setup as the First Step Toward Automation

Sun Ai's catalog states that connecting different machining machines is a prerequisite for true IoT in manufacturing. The SM-P series pallet-type magnetic chucks (EROWA/3R/Honma Multi Chuck compatible) allow workpieces to be transferred between EDM, grinding, machining center, and CMM while remaining clamped—eliminating re-presetting at each station. Available in standard, milling-compatible, circular, and jet-compatible variants with sizes from SM-P0505 (55×55mm effective range) to SM-P3030 (300×300mm).

The SEP-02A(B) pre-setter enables more than 20% productivity improvement with rapid return on investment—a compelling case for small and medium manufacturers who cannot justify large capital equipment but must remain competitive in high-precision markets.

## まとめ

Three key points from this article:

1. **Uniform magnetic clamping eliminates pre-machining deformation.** The SM-H, SM-C, SM-UC, and SM-S/SH circular series all hold workpieces across their entire contact surface, removing the jaw-induced distortion that makes thin plate and titanium precision impossible with conventional fixtures.
2. **Circularity and surface finish improve dramatically when off-site setup is systematic.** Data shows circularity improving from 0.0044mm to 0.0015mm and Ra from 1.16μm to 0.13μm when the SER-01A electrode rotating device is combined with presetting on the SEP-02A(B).
3. **Pallet-type magnetic chucks bridge individual machines into an integrated flow.** The SM-P series enables unmanned workpiece transfer across EDM, grinding, and CMM stations—the practical first step toward factory automation without massive capital investment.
