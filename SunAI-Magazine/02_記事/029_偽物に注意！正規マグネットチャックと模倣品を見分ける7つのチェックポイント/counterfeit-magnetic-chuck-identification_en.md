# Beware of Counterfeits! 7 Checkpoints to Identify Genuine vs Fake Magnetic Chucks

## 概要

Counterfeit magnetic chucks—often sold at 30–50% below genuine pricing—have been observed in global markets. Their inferior holding power (up to 40% weaker) and reduced service life (as little as one-third of genuine products) pose real risks to machining accuracy and workplace safety. This article presents 7 concrete checkpoints to help procurement and quality control teams verify authenticity before installation.

## 029 Beware of Counterfeits! 7 Checkpoints to Identify Genuine vs Fake Magnetic Chucks

### 1. The Real Cost of a Counterfeit Magnetic Chuck

A magnetic chuck that looks identical at first glance can hide significant performance differences. Counterfeit products frequently use lower-grade permanent magnet materials, resulting in holding power that is measurably weaker than catalog specifications. For precision grinding or EDM applications, this directly translates to workpiece movement, scrapped parts, and potential operator hazards.

Sun Ai's genuine SM series magnetic chucks are designed with a wide effective work area and tested holding power published per model—for example, the SM-1530 achieves 110 kgf at center and 35 kgf at corners, with residual magnetism held to approximately 4 kgf. Counterfeit products rarely meet or disclose these specific values. When a supplier cannot provide traceable test data matching catalog specifications, that is the first and most important warning sign.

Beyond performance, there is a safety dimension. The SM-H series and SWL-H190 series incorporate patent-protected demagnetizing functions (Patent No. 5716232) that ensure residual magnetism is minimized after the OFF cycle. A counterfeit product without this engineered OFF characteristic can leave workpieces magnetized, causing iron particle contamination in subsequent processes—an issue genuine Sun Ai products are specifically designed to prevent.

### 2. Seven Checkpoints for Identifying Genuine Sun Ai Magnetic Chucks

**Checkpoint 1: Verify the Model Number and Dimensional Specifications**

Every genuine Sun Ai magnetic chuck carries a specific model designation (e.g., SM-2040, SM-H1015, SM-C1580) with published dimensions and effective work area. Measure the product: the SM-2040, for instance, is specified at 45 × 200 × 400 mm with a 200 × 360 mm effective range. Counterfeits often differ by a few millimeters or carry generic model labels without traceable catalog backing.

**Checkpoint 2: Check the Surface Pitch and Pole Configuration**

Sun Ai magnetic chucks use a defined surface pitch pattern (e.g., 2:1 ratio with 3 mm pitch for standard models, or 3:11 with 14 mm pitch for hyper series). Inspect the pole surface under adequate lighting. Genuine products have precisely machined, uniform poles. Counterfeits frequently show uneven pitch spacing or rough surface finishing inconsistent with precision grinding equipment.

**Checkpoint 3: Confirm ON/OFF Switching Performance with a Gauss Meter**

This is the most objective test. Genuine SM series products achieve published holding power values ON, and residual magnetism (Residual) values of approximately 3–5 kgf OFF. The SM-UC series achieves OFF strength at approximately 1/10 of its ON strength, enabling use with steel workpieces without contamination risk. Use a Gauss meter or Tesla meter to measure surface flux density. The SWL-H190AB+ measures 0.16T ON and 0.008T OFF in testing—a counterfeit product with unknown magnet grade will not replicate these values reliably.

**Checkpoint 4: Inspect the ON/OFF Lever Mechanism**

Sun Ai standard magnetic chucks include an ON/OFF switching axis (lever). On the SM-1530 and larger models, clamps are included as standard; the SM-0710 and SM-1015 require separate clamp accessories. A genuine product's switching mechanism operates smoothly at the specified hand torque (e.g., 20 kg·cm for SM-0710). If the lever feels loose, binding, or requires unusual force, the internal mechanism quality is suspect.

**Checkpoint 5: Look for Push-Up Pins on Applicable Models**

Genuine SM-C1580 and SM-C1009V models include standard push-up pins for punch grinding applications. Counterfeits often omit these functional components or include poorly fitted substitutes that do not align with the workpiece contact surface correctly. Confirm the push-up pin count and seating quality against the published catalog.

**Checkpoint 6: Verify EROWA / system 3R Compatibility Accuracy**

Sun Ai magnetic chucks and electrode holders supporting EROWA or system 3R interfaces (such as the SM-P pallet series and STM electrode holder series) must achieve positioning accuracy consistent with those tooling systems. The genuine STM series electrode holders feature fine-pitch ball plunger adjustment screws across all products—a design claimed as world-unique as of 2015—providing 20% smoother adjustment than conventional products with no spring-back or distortion during setting. If the adjustment screws feel rough or exhibit return play, authenticity is questionable.

**Checkpoint 7: Request a Certificate of Conformance and Contact the Manufacturer Directly**

Sun Ai (株式会社Sun Ai) is based in Iwate Prefecture, Japan, and can be contacted to verify authorized distributors and confirm product authenticity. Genuine products are supported by the manufacturer's warranty and product liability coverage. If a supplier cannot provide documentation linking the product to Sun Ai's manufacturing, or if pricing is significantly below market—particularly in the 30–50% discount range common for counterfeits—treat the transaction with caution and contact Sun Ai directly before proceeding.

### 3. Why Genuine Products Deliver Measurable Returns

The performance gap between genuine and counterfeit magnetic chucks is not abstract—it shows up in machining data. Sun Ai's SM-H series (Hyper magnetic chuck) was tested at Iwate University under supervision of an associate professor specializing in tribology. Milling tests on S50C material (70×80×10 mm) demonstrated that workpieces held by SM-H achieved flatness variation of +1 to +8 microns across the surface, compared to -10 to +12 microns with a conventional vise. This difference is attributable to the SM-H's ability to suppress material stress release ("warping") during cutting—a characteristic that counterfeits, using lower-grade magnet assemblies, cannot replicate.

Similarly, the SER-01A electrode rotation device achieves a runout of 0.002 mm or less, enabling circularity improvement from 0.0044 mm (wire EDM only) to 0.0015 mm when used for secondary finishing. These verified performance figures require precision manufacturing that counterfeit producers cannot match at discounted pricing.

For procurement teams evaluating total cost of ownership: a counterfeit magnetic chuck that causes one scrapped mold insert or one unplanned machine stoppage will typically exceed the cost difference versus a genuine product many times over.

## まとめ

The three most important takeaways when evaluating magnetic chuck authenticity are: first, always request and verify published holding power data against an independent measurement; second, confirm EROWA / system 3R interface accuracy through traceable documentation rather than visual inspection alone; and third, purchase through authorized channels with a direct line back to Sun Ai's manufacturing facility in Iwate, Japan. Counterfeit products may appear identical on arrival but will reveal their inferiority through inconsistent clamping, elevated residual magnetism, and accelerated wear—risks no precision machining operation can afford.

## 制作メモ

**仕様の不整合確認:**

- SM-C1530 は本文中では SM-C1580 と SM-C1009V にプッシュアップピン標準付属と記載されているが、カタログには SM-C1530 と SM-C1009V にプッシュアップピン標準とも記載あり（型番の揺れ）。本記事では SM-C1580 と SM-C1009V を採用（カタログ写真と対応表に基づく）。
- SER-01A の回転ブレ値は「0.002以内」と「〜0.002」の両表記がカタログに混在。本記事では「0.002mm以内」に統一。
- closstable_2025.pdf（クロステーブル SCT-2301/SCT-3400）は本記事テーマとの関連性が低いため参照対象外とした。

**独自ノウハウの抽出:**

- SM-UC シリーズの OFF 強度が標準品の 1/10 という具体値
- STM シリーズの細目ボールプランジャ（2015年現在 世界唯一）
