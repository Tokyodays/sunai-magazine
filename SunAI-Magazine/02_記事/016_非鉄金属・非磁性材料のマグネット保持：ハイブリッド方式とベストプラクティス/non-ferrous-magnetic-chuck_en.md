## 016 Holding Non-Ferrous and Non-Magnetic Materials with Magnetic Chucks: Hybrid Methods and Best Practices

### 1. The Misunderstanding: Why "Magnetic Chucks Don't Work on Non-Ferrous Materials" Is Only Half the Story

Magnetic chucks attract and hold workpieces through magnetic flux. Materials like mild steel and tool steel are highly permeable — they allow magnetic flux to pass through easily and are held firmly. Aluminum, copper, SUS304 stainless steel, and titanium, on the other hand, have low or zero magnetic permeability, which is why they cannot be held by magnetic force directly.

This is an accurate physical description. But it is not the end of the story.

The critical insight is this: **a magnetic chuck does not need to attract the workpiece directly**. It needs to generate a strong, stable holding force at the workpiece interface. With the right intermediate approach, non-ferrous and non-magnetic materials can be held precisely and securely.

Furthermore, even for materials that are technically "magnetic" — such as SUS410 stainless steel — the degree of magnetism varies considerably. Sun Ai's SM-UC series, for example, offers an OFF-state residual magnetism of just 1/10th of its ON-state force, meaning that workpieces with slight magnetic sensitivity can be held during machining and released cleanly afterward without retaining residual magnetism that would otherwise cause iron chip adhesion.

**Specification note:** The SM-H series, developed in collaboration with tribology researchers at Iwate University and supported by the Small and Medium Enterprise Agency (中小企業庁長官賞), achieves ON-state holding roughly twice that of conventional magnetic chucks while its OFF-state is approximately 1/5 — verified through testing at the Iwate Prefectural Industrial Technology Center. These figures reflect real-world performance on ferrous workpieces and set a benchmark for understanding what hybrid methods must achieve for non-ferrous materials.

### 2. Three Methods for Holding Non-Ferrous and Non-Magnetic Workpieces

#### Method 1: Magnetic Plate (Steel Sandwich) Method

The most straightforward approach. A ferrous adapter plate — typically SUS410 or a tool steel shim — is placed between the magnetic chuck surface and the non-ferrous workpiece. The chuck holds the adapter plate; the adapter plate holds the workpiece through mechanical clamping, adhesive, or press-fit.

**How it works in practice:**

Sun Ai's SWL-H190 series (电极 holder for wire EDM) includes an underscore set (アンダーバー一式) made from SUS410. The SUS410 plate is attracted to the chuck surface. The non-ferrous workpiece is then positioned on top of, or clamped against, the SUS410 adapter. The clamp space can be reduced to 2 mm with optional offset bars.

**Critical safety note:** When using offset bars and spacers to reduce clamping space, the risk of workpiece falling increases as the clamping space narrows. Extreme care must be taken when positioning the workpiece. This is explicitly stated in Sun Ai's catalog and must not be omitted in any setup procedure.

**Holding force reference:** The SWL-H190AB+ achieves a magnetic flux density of 0.16 T (ON state) with residual magnetism of only 0.008 T (OFF state), measured using a test specimen of 100 × 100 × t10 mm. The standard SWL-H190AB and SWL-H100αβ achieve 0.06 T ON / 0.006 T OFF. Post-machining magnetic inspection of workpieces confirmed that magnetic force has almost no effect on the machining process itself.

**Best for:** Aluminum alloy plates, copper electrodes held for EDM, thin workpieces requiring flat clamping.

**Cost:** Low incremental cost — uses existing magnetic chuck with SUS410 adapter shims.

#### Method 2: Vacuum-Assisted Hybrid Method

In this method, a vacuum chuck or vacuum pods are used in combination with a magnetic chuck. The magnetic chuck provides the stable base (no power wiring required, no risk of sudden release), while the vacuum system provides the holding force directly against the non-ferrous workpiece surface.

**Why magnetic + vacuum?**

A standalone vacuum chuck requires a continuous vacuum source and is vulnerable to power interruptions. A magnetic chuck, once energized by rotating the ON/OFF lever, holds without any electrical connection. Sun Ai's SWL-H190 series requires no electrical wiring after installation — processing begins immediately. The demagnetizing function (特許第5716232号) eliminates the need for a separate post-machining demagnetizing step, even when the workpiece is an SUS410-type that retains slight residual magnetism during machining.

By mounting a vacuum plate or porous ceramic vacuum pod on the magnetic chuck surface (held via SUS410 adapter), the combination achieves strong holding force on non-ferrous surfaces while benefiting from the magnetic chuck's simplicity and reliability.

**Holding force reference:** Clamping force tests for the SWL-H190 series measured at a 100 mm test point show: SWL-H190AB+ at 200 N (with optional enhancement up to 300 N), SWL-H190AB and SWL-H100αβ at 150 N or more in the Z direction. Load measurement in the Z direction confirms the system's suitability for surface grinding applications on non-ferrous materials.

**Best for:** Aluminum sheet, titanium plate, SUS304 and SUS316L thin workpieces, optical component substrates.

**Cost:** Medium — requires vacuum pump and vacuum plate investment, but reuses existing magnetic chuck infrastructure.

#### Method 3: Adhesive-Assisted Method (Low-Melting Alloy or UV Adhesive)

For workpieces where neither the adapter plate nor vacuum methods provide sufficient stability — particularly small, thin, or irregularly shaped non-ferrous parts — a temporary adhesive layer bonds the workpiece to a ferrous carrier plate. The carrier plate is held by the magnetic chuck. After machining, the adhesive is released by heat (low-melting alloy), solvent, or UV de-bonding.

**Connection to Sun Ai's product range:**

The SM-C series (cemented carbide magnetic chucks) demonstrates that even non-traditional magnetic materials can be processed at high precision when the holding method is correctly matched to the workpiece. The SM-C1009V, designed for vertical profiling, and the SM-CNO series (ON-only, no OFF function, generating center magnetic flux density of 4,000 Gauss or more in the SM-CNO1112) provide the strong ON-state force needed to hold a ferrous carrier plate loaded with a non-ferrous workpiece. The SM-CNO series has no ON/OFF function — users must remove wristwatches and precision instruments before working nearby.

Circularity measurement data from Sun Ai's electrode rotation device (電極回転装置) processing tests shows that post-processing with the SER-01A achieves circularity of 0.0015 mm compared to 0.0044 mm for wire EDM alone — a threefold improvement. When applied to non-ferrous workpieces held via adhesive on a carrier plate, this level of final-pass precision becomes achievable.

**Best for:** Small non-ferrous components, optical elements, medical implant substrates, aerospace titanium blanks requiring ultra-flat finishing.

**Cost:** Medium-high — adhesive materials and release process add cycle time, but tooling cost is minimal.

### 3. Selecting the Right Magnetic Chuck for Hybrid Workholding

The three methods above are independent of the specific magnetic chuck model, but the choice of chuck significantly affects the result. The following guidance applies Sun Ai's lineup to the three non-ferrous workholding scenarios.

**For precision flat grinding of non-ferrous plates (adapter plate or vacuum hybrid):**

The SM-H series (Hyper magnetic chuck) is the recommended base unit. University-validated data shows ON holding force approximately twice that of conventional chucks. The SM-H1015 (100 × 160 × t45 mm), SM-H1520, SM-H2020, and SM-H2030 cover a range of table sizes. The SM-3H sub-series (surface pitch 2:3 mm) is optimized for thin workpiece holding. EROWA and system 3R compatibility is available as an option, enabling pallet-based automation.

The SM-H series' key advantage for non-ferrous hybrid setups is flatness control during machining. Milling test results on S50C (70 × 80 × t10 mm, cutter φ40 mm, S1000, F200) showed that using a conventional vise produced warp values up to +12 microns, while SM-3H holding constrained material stress relief and produced significantly more uniform results. The same principle applies when a ferrous carrier plate is used: the chuck's flat clamping force prevents the carrier plate from warping, which in turn prevents the bonded non-ferrous workpiece from distorting.

**For EDM and 3D measurement transfer of non-ferrous workpieces (pallet magnetic chuck):**

The SM-P series (pallet-type magnetic chuck) is specifically designed to transfer workpieces between machining centers, EDM machines, surface grinders, and CMMs without re-fixturing. This is the direct enabler of IoT-connected manufacturing: workpieces held on SM-P pallets move between machines while maintaining positional accuracy. Compatible with EROWA, system 3R, and Honma Multi Chuck systems.

For non-ferrous workpieces, the SM-P series holds a ferrous carrier plate (or SUS410 pallet sub-plate) to which the non-ferrous workpiece is adhesively or mechanically fixed. The pallet then transfers between machines. The SM-HP series (milling-compatible pallet magnetic chuck) withstands medium milling cutting forces, rated at 340 kgf.

**For small non-ferrous workpieces requiring strong ON-force (adhesive method):**

The SM-CNO series (CNO = ON-only, no OFF) generates the highest ON-state magnetic flux density in Sun Ai's lineup. The SM-CNO1112 measures center flux density exceeding 4,000 Gauss. Since the SM-CNO series has no OFF function, carrier plates loaded with non-ferrous workpieces must be removed mechanically after machining.

**Specification consistency note:** The SM-UC series catalog states that its ON-state holding force is 1.5 times the standard SM-C series, while OFF-state force is 1/10 of standard. The SM-CNO series catalog separately notes it has no ON/OFF function. These two product lines serve different roles: SM-UC for balanced on/off switching (suitable for steel workpieces where residual magnetism must be avoided), SM-CNO for maximum grip strength where the workpiece can be mechanically removed. Both can serve as the base chuck in an adapter-plate hybrid setup for non-ferrous materials.

## まとめ

The belief that magnetic chucks cannot be used for non-ferrous or non-magnetic materials reflects an incomplete understanding of workholding physics. Three practical methods — magnetic plate sandwich, vacuum-assisted hybrid, and adhesive-assisted carrier — each extend magnetic chuck capability to aluminum, copper, SUS304, SUS316L, and titanium workpieces.

Sun Ai's lineup addresses each scenario: the SM-H series delivers the flat, high-force clamping needed for precision grinding setups; the SM-P pallet series enables cross-machine transfer without re-fixturing; and the SM-CNO series provides maximum ON-state grip for small workpieces held via adhesive carriers. The SWL-H190 series adds air-controlled magnetic force switching, built-in demagnetization (特許第5716232号), and a design registration (意匠登録1666196) — all without electrical wiring.

When selecting a method, prioritize workpiece geometry, required surface finish (平面度), circularity (真円度), and squareness (直角度) targets. Match the magnetic chuck model to the holding force and transfer requirements of your specific production flow.
