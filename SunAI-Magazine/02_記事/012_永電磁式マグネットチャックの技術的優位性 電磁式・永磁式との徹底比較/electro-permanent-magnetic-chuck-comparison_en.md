## 012 Why Electro-Permanent Magnetic Chucks Outperform Electromagnetic and Permanent Magnetic Types: A Data-Driven Comparison

### 1. The Three Types of Magnetic Chucks — and Why the Difference Matters

In precision machining — EDM, surface grinding, milling, and coordinate measurement — the chuck is not a passive component. It is the foundation on which all dimensional accuracy is built. Choose the wrong type, and no downstream process can recover the lost tolerance.

There are three categories of magnetic clamping technology in widespread industrial use:

**Electromagnetic chucks** generate holding force by running continuous electrical current through a coil. The field exists only while current flows — meaning that a power interruption instantly releases the workpiece. Holding force is adjustable via current, but the chuck consumes energy continuously and generates heat during extended machining cycles.

**Permanent magnetic chucks** use rare-earth or ferrite magnets to create a static field. No power is needed to maintain the hold, and there is no heat generation. However, the field cannot be switched off electronically; an operator must physically rotate a lever to cancel the flux, and adjusting holding force requires mechanical intervention.

**Electro-permanent magnetic chucks** combine both technologies. A brief electrical pulse — applied only at the moment of switching — polarizes an internal array of AlNiCo magnets. Once set, the field is maintained entirely by the permanent magnet component; no further electrical input is required. A second pulse of opposite polarity releases the workpiece. Sun Ai's SM series, SM-H series, and SWL-H190 series all operate on this principle.

### 2. Four-Axis Quantitative Comparison

The following analysis draws directly from Sun Ai's product documentation and performance verification data, including university-conducted tribology testing at Iwate University's Engineering Department.

#### 2-1. Clamping Force Stability

|Metric|Electromagnetic|Permanent Magnetic|Electro-Permanent (Sun Ai SM-H)|
|---|---|---|---|
|ON-state holding force|Variable (current-dependent)|Fixed (mechanical)|Strong and stable|
|OFF-state residual force|Zero (field collapses)|Requires lever operation|~1/5 of standard product|
|Force drift during machining|Possible (thermal/coil resistance)|None|None|
|University test result (ON)|—|—|Approx. 2× conventional product|
|University test result (OFF)|—|—|Approx. 80% less than conventional|

Sun Ai's SM-H Series underwent sliding friction tests and tensile tests at Iwate University (test piece: 10×60×t10mm, S45C and SKD61, n=6). In the Z-direction load test, ON-state performance was approximately double that of a conventional electromagnetic chuck of equivalent size. In the upward tensile direction (OFF state), residual force was reduced by approximately 80%. This clean ON/OFF characteristic is the direct result of the electro-permanent design: the AlNiCo array can be fully polarized or fully reversed, leaving negligible residual magnetism in the workpiece.

For the SWL-H190AB+ variant, magnetic flux density measurements confirm ON: 0.16T, OFF: 0.008T — a ratio of 20:1. Even under extended operation, the field does not drift because no continuous current flows through the coil.

**Specification note:** The SWL-H190AB (standard) and SWL-H100αβ measure ON: 0.06T / OFF: 0.006T. Users requiring maximum holding force should select the AB+ variant, while accepting that a small residual field (~0.008T) remains at OFF. This is documented in Sun Ai's catalog and should be factored into workpiece demagnetization planning.

#### 2-2. Power Consumption

|Phase|Electromagnetic|Permanent Magnetic|Electro-Permanent (Sun Ai)|
|---|---|---|---|
|During clamping (machining)|Continuous draw|Zero|Zero|
|At switching moment|N/A (always ON)|Mechanical only|Brief electrical pulse only|
|Heat generation|Significant|None|None|

Electromagnetic chucks consume power continuously. Over a full production shift, this represents measurable energy cost and introduces thermal expansion risk in the chuck body — a factor that directly degrades flatness and squareness of the clamped workpiece surface. Sun Ai's electro-permanent chucks require electricity only at the switching instant. Installation requires no electrical wiring beyond the air-line supply for the SWL-H190 series: "No need for wiring such as electricity. Can be processed immediately after being attached to the processing machine."

This eliminates a common retrofit obstacle in brownfield facilities where additional electrical circuits are difficult or cost-prohibitive to install.

#### 2-3. Fail-Safe Performance During Power Outage

|Scenario|Electromagnetic|Permanent Magnetic|Electro-Permanent (Sun Ai)|
|---|---|---|---|
|Power interruption during machining|Workpiece released immediately|Holding force maintained|Holding force maintained|
|Risk to operator|Workpiece ejection|None|None|
|Required safety interlock|Mandatory|Not required|Not required|

This is the most operationally critical distinction. An electromagnetic chuck that loses power during a grinding or milling pass will release the workpiece into a rotating cutter or grinding wheel — a serious safety and quality incident. Sun Ai's electro-permanent technology maintains full holding force indefinitely without power, because the hold is sustained by the permanent magnet array, not by electrical current. Patent No. 5716232 (Japan) covers the demagnetization function that eliminates the need for post-process demagnetization treatment.

#### 2-4. Operational Convenience

|Feature|Electromagnetic|Permanent Magnetic|Electro-Permanent (Sun Ai SWL-H190)|
|---|---|---|---|
|Workpiece clamping time|Instantaneous|Manual lever (~5–10 sec)|1 second|
|Demagnetization after machining|Required (separate process)|Required (lever)|Automatic (built-in)|
|Electrical wiring required|Yes|No|No (air-line only)|
|Compatible with automation/robot|Limited (power dependency)|Limited (manual operation)|Yes (EROWA / system 3R compatible)|

The SWL-H190 series clamps a workpiece in 1 second. The built-in demagnetization function (特許第5716232号) eliminates the separate demagnetization step after machining — directly reducing cycle time and operator workload. The unique L-design (Design Right 1666196) allows the chuck to be mounted directly on a wire EDM machine without additional wiring, enabling immediate production start.

For automated cell integration, the pallet-type magnetic chuck (SM-P series) supports EROWA, system 3R, and Honma Multi Chuck interfaces, allowing workpiece transfer between EDM, surface grinding, machining center, and CMM without re-fixturing or re-presetting.

### 3. Sun Ai's Unique Product Advantages — What No Competitor Replicates

#### Fine-Pitch Ball Plunger Adjustment (STM Series Electrode Holders)

Sun Ai is the only manufacturer in the world to adopt fine-pitch ball plungers for all adjustment screws across its entire electrode holder product line (as of 2015). This design eliminates the deflection and spring-back that occur during adjustment with conventional coarse-thread screws, making electrode alignment 20% faster than competitive products. The STM series supports both EROWA and system 3R chucking systems and is designed with a compact body that does not restrict the machining envelope of the EDM machine.

#### Off-Line Setup (外段取り) — Stopping the Machine Costs Money

Sun Ai's entire product philosophy is captured in the phrase "加工機を止めない" — do not stop the processing machine. The SEP-02A(B) electrode/workpiece pre-setter enables complete electrode and workpiece preparation off-line, adjacent to the machine. Key specifications: axis yawing ±0.001/150mm, XY squareness within 0.003mm, table-to-Z-axis perpendicularity within 0.003mm. Combined with the SST-200 rotary pre-setter (rotational runout within 0.002mm), full-runout and squareness verification can be completed without interrupting the machining cycle.

The SEP-02A(B) has been shown to enable productivity improvements of more than 20%, with rapid return on investment — achievable even for small and medium-sized enterprises that cannot justify large capital expenditure.

#### Cemented Carbide Clamping — A Technically Demanding Application

Standard magnetic chucks cannot reliably hold cemented carbide (超硬材) because carbide is non-magnetic. Sun Ai's SM-C series uses a specialized rare-earth permanent magnet array engineered for this application. The SM-UC series delivers 1.5× the ON-state holding force of the standard SM-C series, with OFF-state residual field reduced to 1/10 — enabling even steel workpieces to be held after machining without significant magnetization. The SM-CNO series is specified for small and thin workpiece retention where maximum ON-state flux density is the overriding priority (center field exceeding 4,000 Gauss for SM-CNO1112).

**Safety note:** When using the optional underscore set (SUS410) with the SWL-H190 series, reducing the clamping space to 2mm increases the risk of workpiece fall. Extreme care must be taken during workpiece grounding in this configuration, as explicitly stated in Sun Ai's catalog documentation.

## まとめ

The three key advantages of Sun Ai's electro-permanent magnetic chuck technology over conventional electromagnetic and permanent magnetic types are:

1. **Superior ON/OFF ratio** — ON-state holding force approximately double that of conventional products; OFF-state residual magnetism reduced to approximately 1/5, minimizing workpiece magnetization and eliminating separate demagnetization processes.
2. **Zero continuous power consumption** — energy is required only at the switching instant, eliminating heat-induced dimensional drift and enabling installation without dedicated electrical circuits.
3. **Inherent fail-safe behavior** — workpiece holding is maintained during power outages, removing a significant safety risk and allowing unmanned 24-hour operation compatible with EROWA and system 3R automation interfaces.

## 制作メモ

**Specification inconsistency notes:**

- The SWL-H190AB+ OFF-state residual magnetism is documented as 0.008T (not zero). This is explicitly acknowledged in the catalog: "The SWL-H190AB+ has a strong holding power, but some residual magnetism remains even when the switch is turned off." This distinction must be preserved in article text to avoid misleading buyers.
- The SM-CNO series has no ON/OFF switching function. The catalog states: "Please be sure to remove the wrist watch. This product has no OFF." This is a critical safety note that must not be omitted from any article covering the SM-CNO series.
- The cross table (SCT series) catalog contains a typographic error: "anywheere" in the English text. Do not replicate this in articles.
- The SER-01A catalog uses the phrase "儲けたくないなら見ないで下さい" (Do not read this if you don't want to profit). Per editorial guidelines, this phrase may be quoted only when directly referencing catalog copy; it should not be used as original editorial content.
- Patent numbers confirmed: 特許第5716232号 (demagnetization function), 特願2024-117025 (pending). Design right: 意匠登録1666196 (L-design).

**Unique knowhow extracted:**

- Fine-pitch ball plunger for all adjustment screws (world-unique, 2015)
- Dual-mode pallet chuck enabling EROWA/3R/Honma Multi Chuck cross-compatibility
- Air-controlled magnetic force (SWL-H190 series) — no electrical wiring required
- SEP-02A(B) concept: place the pre-setter next to the machine, not across the factory
