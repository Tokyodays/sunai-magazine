## 009 Workpiece Materials in Lathe Machining: Clamping Characteristics of Aluminum, Stainless Steel, and Difficult-to-Cut Materials

### 1. Why Material Properties Matter for Clamping

When we talk about "machining a workpiece," the conversation often centers on cutting tools, speeds, and feeds. However, the quality of the final part is also profoundly influenced by **how the workpiece is held**. A workpiece that is not held flat, or one that flexes under clamping pressure, cannot achieve consistent squareness, circularity, or flatness—even on the most advanced machine tool.

Two fundamental questions drive clamping selection for any material:

**Is the material ferromagnetic?** Only ferromagnetic materials (iron, certain steels) can be held directly by a permanent magnetic chuck. Non-magnetic materials—aluminum alloys, austenitic stainless steels, copper, brass, titanium, and cemented carbide—cannot be held magnetically without a fixture or carrier pallet.

**How sensitive is the surface to contact pressure?** Soft materials like aluminum deform under localized scroll-chuck jaw pressure, introducing workpiece distortion that degrades circularity and flatness. Hard, brittle materials like cemented carbide can chip or micro-crack under uneven clamping.

Understanding these two dimensions will guide every clamping decision described below.

### 2. Aluminum — Lightweight, Soft, and Non-Magnetic

#### Cutting Characteristics

Aluminum alloys are among the easiest materials to cut. They produce long, stringy chips and require sharp tooling and good lubrication to achieve a clean surface finish. Thermal management is important because aluminum's high thermal conductivity can cause chip welding on tool edges at high speeds.

#### Clamping Challenges

Aluminum is **non-ferromagnetic**, so standard magnetic chucks cannot attract or hold it directly. Additionally, aluminum's low hardness (typically HB 70–150) means that scroll chuck jaws or vise jaws can indent the surface, distorting the workpiece geometry under clamping force. This effect is particularly significant for thin-walled or disk-shaped workpieces.

#### Recommended Clamping Approach

For circular aluminum workpieces, a **pallet-type magnetic chuck** (Sun Ai SM-P series) used with an EROWA or system 3R pallet carrier is an effective strategy. The workpiece is first fixed to a compatible pallet off-machine (外段取り), and the pallet is then clamped magnetically on the machine. The magnetic force acts on the ferromagnetic pallet, not directly on the aluminum workpiece, eliminating surface indentation.

For thin aluminum disks or ring components requiring circularity below 0.005mm, Sun Ai's **SM-SH series circular magnetic chucks** can be used with a steel carrier fixture. The uniform magnetic attraction across the entire face—versus localized jaw pressure—dramatically reduces workpiece distortion.

> **Note:** When using any pallet or carrier approach with non-magnetic workpieces, ensure that the carrier is properly designed to transmit the cutting forces to the magnetic chuck without slippage. Consult Sun Ai for carrier design guidance.

### 3. Stainless Steel — Corrosion-Resistant but Clamping-Complex

#### Cutting Characteristics

Stainless steel presents a more challenging cutting environment than aluminum. Work-hardening grades (such as austenitic 304 and 316) can harden significantly during cutting if feeds are too low, requiring carbide tooling, higher cutting pressures, and careful thermal management.

#### Magnetic Compatibility: It Depends on the Grade

This is the honest, critical point that engineers must understand:

- **Martensitic and ferritic stainless steels** (e.g., SUS410, SUS430) are **ferromagnetic** and can be held directly by a magnetic chuck.
- **Austenitic stainless steels** (e.g., SUS304, SUS316) are **non-ferromagnetic** and **cannot** be held directly by a magnetic chuck.

The SM-H series hyper magnetic chucks from Sun Ai are well-suited for ferromagnetic stainless workpieces where strong ON clamping and clean OFF release are needed—the ON force is approximately twice that of conventional products, while the OFF residual magnetism is reduced to approximately 1/5, preventing iron particle adhesion to the workpiece after machining.

#### Clamping Challenges for Austenitic Grades

For SUS304 and SUS316 workpieces, the pallet approach described for aluminum also applies. The **SWL-H190AB air-controlled magnetic chuck** uses a unique patented L-design (Design Registration 1666196) and air actuation to clamp workpieces in one second without electrical wiring—ideal for wire EDM and surface grinding applications where simplicity and demagnetization after machining are priorities.

The SWL-H190AB features a built-in demagnetization function (Patent No. 5716232), eliminating the need for a separate demagnetizing step after machining—a significant time saving in high-mix production environments.

> **Safety Note:** When using the offset bar/spacer options on the SWL-H190 series, the clamping space narrows to 2mm. This reduces the effective magnetic contact area and increases the risk of workpiece falling during setup. Extreme care must be taken when positioning the workpiece.

### 4. Difficult-to-Cut Materials (Cemented Carbide, Titanium, Hardened Steel)

#### What Are Difficult-to-Cut Materials?

"Difficult-to-cut" (難削材) is a broad category encompassing materials that pose special challenges due to extreme hardness, brittleness, high heat resistance, or low thermal conductivity. In precision tooling and mold manufacturing, the most frequently encountered difficult-to-cut materials are:

- **Cemented carbide (超硬合金):** Tungsten carbide + cobalt binder, HRA 86–93, extremely brittle
- **Hardened tool steel (焼入鋼):** HRC 55–65, high abrasiveness
- **Titanium alloys:** Non-magnetic, low thermal conductivity, prone to work-hardening

#### Cutting Characteristics

Cemented carbide cannot be machined by conventional cutting—it requires grinding (using diamond or CBN wheels) or electrical discharge machining (EDM). Cutting forces are high, and vibration must be minimized to prevent micro-chipping of the workpiece edge.

Titanium alloys have very low thermal conductivity, causing heat to concentrate at the cutting edge. They also work-harden rapidly, requiring sharp tools, low cutting speeds, and high feed rates.

#### Clamping Challenges

Cemented carbide is **non-ferromagnetic** in the conventional sense—the tungsten carbide phase does not respond to magnetic fields. However, the **cobalt binder** phase has weak ferromagnetic properties, which means standard magnetic chucks have insufficient holding force for safe cemented carbide machining.

Sun Ai developed the **SM-C series cemented carbide magnetic chucks** specifically to address this challenge. The SM-UC sub-series offers ON force 1.5 times that of the standard SM-C, and OFF force reduced to 1/10—the strong OFF release prevents residual magnetism from attracting grinding swarf to the finished workpiece surface.

For profile grinding (縦置き), the **SM-C1009V vertical magnetic chuck** provides a dedicated solution. The SM-CNO series maximizes ON holding force for very small or thin workpieces where contact area is limited—note that the SM-CNO series has no ON/OFF function, so care must be taken to remove precision instruments such as wristwatches before operation.

For hardened steel workpieces that are ferromagnetic, the **SM-H series hyper magnetic chucks** are highly effective. University tribology tests (Iwate University, Associate Professor Yoshino, Engineering Department) confirmed that the SM-H series demonstrates ON holding force approximately twice that of conventional products in the Z-direction, while OFF force is reduced to approximately 1/5—enabling milling operations to be performed with grinding-machine-level flatness accuracy.

### 6. The Role of Off-Machine Setup (外段取り) Across All Material Types

Regardless of material, the productivity impact of **外段取り** (off-machine setup) is consistent: by preparing and pre-setting workpieces while the machine continues running, machine stop time approaches zero.

Sun Ai's **SEP-02A(B) super-precision electrode/workpiece pre-setter** is designed with the concept of placement directly alongside the processing machine. Its compact footprint (Z1500 × Y650 × X450mm, 220kg) fits in tight shop floor layouts while maintaining squareness between X-Y axes within 0.003mm and table-to-Z-axis perpendicularity within 0.003mm.

When the optional **SST-200 rotation pre-setter** is mounted on the SEP-02A(B), rotational runout measurement and electrode center adjustment can be performed with rotational accuracy within **0.002mm** against EROWA and system 3R masters—enabling pre-setting verification that matches the machine tool's precision.

This combination—correct magnetic clamping for the material type, combined with off-machine pre-setting—is what enables Sun Ai's stated **20% or greater productivity improvement** with rapid investment recovery, accessible even to small and medium-sized enterprises.

## まとめ

Three key points to take away from this article:

**1. Match the clamping method to the material's magnetic nature.** Aluminum, austenitic stainless, cemented carbide, and titanium cannot be held directly by standard magnetic chucks. Use pallet systems or material-specific chuck designs.

**2. Magnetic force characteristics matter as much as ON force.** Low OFF residual magnetism is critical for cemented carbide and precision steel workpieces—it prevents swarf adhesion and eliminates post-machining demagnetization steps.

**3. Off-machine setup (外段取り) multiplies the value of correct clamping.** Any workholding investment pays back faster when combined with pre-setter-enabled off-machine setup workflows.
